But let's not stop at that.
one solution that solves it all,
So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's,

But the one thing that I always looked forward to
having games for us,
or a Google Glass, or something like that.
But I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective.
And he's not the only one in the world.
But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health.
because it is a continuous motion.
So as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events.
He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.
This print could be taken into hospitals
What we need are human-centered solutions.

So, well, one problem solved,
And the turns, he took them so easily.
He walked faster, right?
So this person, who used to be the center of attention
and then I realized that I was getting very superficial information,
Because in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase
so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms,
and then all this while, I'm thinking,
Let's make a smarter world, but with simplicity.
He told me that I made him feel like his old self again.
And there was always this one uncle

and this number is only rising.
Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right?
The curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors,
I call this the staircase illusion,
All this while, I was interviewing him,
Imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions.
Is he really, really going to do it without his walker?"
So the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase
I bet a lot of you all must have heard about it.
You can also target simple problems
and it took forever.
So I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks,
feel like my uncle felt that day.
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
One actually has to climb the stairs.
he literally had to take one step at a time, like this,
or just answers to my questions.
On researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion.

"Well, let me show you how I do it."
but the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look.
and that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in.

"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?

There's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms
But I stuck to simple print on the floor.
I could have easily made it into a projection,
But the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product.
So he took really long to reach this position,
All we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity,
and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup.
it struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land,
Let's find these complex problems. Don't be scared of them.
And then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table,
all his symptoms vanish,
It works just purely on its form.
Let's take a look at what I saw.
And a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him,
What would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions?
but with newer insights to make it better.
so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.
while he's eating, while he's watching TV.
My uncle started using a walker to walk,
So it happens a lot,
was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.
and this is called freezing of gait.
Test these solutions, fail if needed,
and then make an impact.
how does he climb a staircase?
and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze,
But why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective?
just out of embarrassment,
It looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person,

So this is kind of the common-sense model, I think,
There are also more scientific versions of this,
If you have a memory transplant, are you the same person?
you find it in 17th, 18th-century philosophy
Because I just invite you to think about, by comparison,
that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self,
as a mystery, and maybe never ever find.
if you believe in an afterlife, maybe you continue.
Well, clearly there are memories, desires, intentions, sensations,
Now this view is not particularly new, actually.
and these memories help to create what you are.
The most kind of crude way in which we have it,
People put them on their Facebook profile

Now if everything else in the universe is like this,
the challenge actually has a very, very long and distinguished history.
It's not just intellectual things.
of what a person is.
There's no mystery about my watch, for example.
But I don't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it.
It has quite a long lineage.
then I think that's quite liberating.
Because unlike the the waterfalls,
it's just that the trick is to make us feel that inside of us
You know, people are very wedded to these, actually.
because they all belong to one body and one brain.

There is no kind of center where everything happens.

It's like a mechanical trick.

And of course, the popular fascination with this is enormous.
maybe apart from the very most fundamental forces or powers.
there's nothing permanent about this.
And this, I think, is very, very significant,
might strike you as kind of weird.
does that mean that really, the self is an illusion?
Now in your life, what happens is that you, of course,
a lot of these people do talk the language of illusion,
or that they are the messiah.
why are we different?
it's hard to resist, isn't it?
We do things because of other things.
And I can show you what's wrong with one click.
Now this idea, that what we are, the way to understand ourselves,
So I want to get that message over, that what we need to do
It's not that we don't exist,
accumulate different experiences and so forth.
But it doesn't mean that the Iguazu Falls are an illusion.

If there's anything real in the world, it's you.
You answer a lot of questions,

Strange thought? Well, maybe not.

But the suggestion I want to put to you today

And so really, there are all these things,

they're overlapped, they're connected in various different ways.

First of all, it's really hard to use -- really hard to use.
And the man's name is Carl Norden.
I last did a TED Talk
getting nowhere, making no progress,
conditions aren't perfect.
The issue was they didn't know where the Scud launchers were.
And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane,
that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb.
was very enamored of German engineers.
It's a real pleasure to be here.
And of course, in wartime,
Carl Norden emigrates to the United States
on this absolutely essential piece of technology.
And he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.
It allowed you to bomb only those things
from the microchips implanted in your brain?"
and then I went on to the United Nations school,
you know, I'm probably
in the top five songs, you need to holler at me.
You guys are a-mazing, by the way.
that my people are going to answer,
Thank y'all for thinking about that
are not familiar with my work,
we ended up going to the White House to perform.
So that's my feeling about that.
if you don't love yourself inside,
and I never been at TED before,
like, maybe they didn't understand that, like,
black and white, Caribbean,
and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like
what can be so frightening
First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate
Am I right, or am I right?
All right, next question.
I don't really talk like that,
well, let us just say I like to think that
"Will there ever be a post-racial world?"
And, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,
a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family
who are working to address that,
Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact
Okay, next question. (Applause)
and I do hope that we can continue
My dental work not as nice as some people.
that there are role models here that I can really,
I have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day
some of them don't even have names,
And I just kept saying it: "Oh my God. Oh my God."
But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism,
But if had to give my opinion about meat,
there's a lot of things more important
Sotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter)
so with that, if anything I've said today
a pretty orderly group.
that we don't have to have perfect food,
but my kids, they are American-Chinese,
Well, it is the future.
that I hope you can hear me okay.
that the present is the new future,
but it's difficult to try to express myself
but that was one of my people,
and my name is Bella,
have been 3-D printed as such,
you know what I mean?
in sort of a meta way,
But what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,
flying by the seat of my ass.
She loved her husband, it was the sweetest thing.
who's, like, obviously, like, a really important feminist from, like, history,
that where you sit, you create everything
How are people living today?
is 'cos I hold the microphone
There was Dominican music blasting from stereos.
I create multicultural characters,
but you know, I just want to say,
because I was born in the '90s,
So I think I've lost my way.
that needs to be sustainable and everything,
And, you know, she said she would love him
enjoy yourself, LGBTQLMNOP. All right?
I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation.
Okay, well, I'm just gonna answer this really fast,
as, like, three or four different people.
be vital and, like, amazing,
Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED.
but the first way y'all can always know,
So anyway, I would have to say my top five songs right now
I really, like, I just want to say,
That's incredible to me, and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that,
You know, that kind of thing.
because it's a modern world,
There were Christians and Jews.
Keep your noses clean.
that I believe the diet that we need
well, there are starving children.
you know what I'm saying.
I'm also a professional stand-up comedian.
and as somebody living on the streets in New York,
"Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown?"
But I always like to just let people know
No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them,
that dating is never boring under any circumstance.
and some of these characters have been with me for ages,
I don't know why. You know what I'm saying.
all of whom were loosely based on people I really know,
I think there's a lot of great people here at TED
I love you all. You're wonderful.
Okay, ciao, gracias.
this environment, I would like to sustain.
Okay, next question. (Applause)
in front of audience of people like this.
Next question. (Applause)
It's fabulous to be here with such big machers
and, like, I'm named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug,
that I've never seen
Like, I like my voice.
or, like, a certain way of presenting yourself
now that humans reproduce asexually?"
it's so incredible to be here, and I knew that we were going to have these questions.
Irish-American, German-American.
frankly, just putting on my glasses reminds me
a certain kind of voice,
so I am just trying to remind myself that,
and answer some random questions?
but to me, it's like, another level, okay?
I'm also half Lakota, but that is my given name,
But everybody, please do enjoy that,
Maybe we can have some middle ground for that.
So I began sort of developing these voices
it was, like, unbelievable,
There is nothing wrong with a woman of size.
however you reproduce, as long as you're enjoying yourself
My name is Lorraine Levine,
there is no diet on this Earth
a feminist like me, like,
and you don't have to wear, like,
and I'm standing here saying, "Oh my God."
I mean, trying to answer these questions, it is very exciting.
First of all, for those of you who
please, you have to eat that, you know,
feminism can be really hot,
Like, the quotation I'm wearing is from, like,
What has changed? Okay, it's like,
but also across the, like, vocal ranges,
in an official emcee posture.
I would just like to say as an African woman
parents are kind of telling their small children,
and, like, there were a lot of women who were
but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me,
and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain,
and so, for example, in performing them,
we're going to have to answer, like, some random questions,
so that you can have this meal.
Now I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,
in New York. You know what I'm saying?
And this guy's older.
Thank you for trusting me, Chris.
a cracking good party here at TED.
Okay. Next question.
and again, I think that you do throw
That's it. That's enough.
"Do you ever get headaches
I would really try to inhabit them.
Women, celebrate your body, for God's sake.
Hi, um, okay, hi everybody.
kind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print.
just to, like, prove that you are a feminist.
You know what I'm saying.
but that notion of thinking about
That is what I am trying to say.
is the wrong word for it anyway.
Well I have to say that I don't know about
But I am very excited to be here right now,
that is going to make your behind small enough
I mean, I remember hearing this woman.
I don't know, I just need to say that.
As long as the woman, in my case --
and I'm standing there,
you know, as far as I'm concerned,
that means, like, so strict it's ridiculous.
and I'm going to bring a few of my friends --
I was so nervous and I was thinking just, like, oh my God, oh my God,
What are your top five favorite songs right now?
You know, I might not have me no place
So we're talking about what's the most popular diet?
I don't know what to call myself now,
intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.
It's a pretty young girl, you know?
this is my first time here at TED.
and, you know, I just need to say it, like,
and all I can do is remind myself
so characters from lots of different backgrounds.
All right, so you get your little tutorial right there.
I mean, it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk.
I appreciate it. Bye-bye.
You know what I'm saying? (Laughter)
especially since the last time we were here at TED,
You know, whenever they want to do a diversity day,
But when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here,
"How many of your organs have been 3D printed?"
just putting on the regular ones I have
But as far as I'm concerned,
I just need to, like, say some affirmations
Next. Next. (Applause)
so many crazy things happened, like,
you know what I'm saying,
Thank you for having me.
Nobody is starving anymore, thank God.
I'm just gonna let y'all know that, as far as diet is concerned,
why do you have to wear pants that, like,
to be feminist, because I think that, like,
I just want to say first of all
and reminding me, because I've had, like, some very,
First of all, that I'm in hip hop, you know what I'm saying.
so just stop wasting your time.
that TED is an incredible experience right now
You know where I'm going with that.
objectify your body? I like my pants.
you know what I'm saying, I'm the only dude up here right now.
and it's with another consenting asexual -- I don't know.
again this year. Mwah!
"What's the most popular diet these days?"
That's a long story filled with
as much into the music,
I think, Sarah Jones, maybe she didn't want me to come out last time.
and I will report back maybe next year.
restriculous within feminism,
already gives me too much information.
no, I did not go into politics.
You know what I'm saying, just stand up there
I want to start by saying
that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd,
It's just, I couldn't, like, I couldn't process.
But I made Sarah Jones promise
Okay, next question.
But I also, I just need to acknowledge
I might not be your typical person
she gonna bring me this time,
of course it means something to you,
makes you feel uncomfortable, you're welcome.
then I'm there. (Laughter)
I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that
that this is a very difficult experience
and I think actually that it's really vital and important.
I don't know what's coming,
you know, as a member of the First Nations community,
that's gonna come, for better or worse.
Don't say, "Oh my God."
Do I think there will ever be a post-racial world?
I know some of y'all may be not really
'cause she didn't bring me before,
is really to remove the crazy belief
I don't know if that's true for other people,
My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that.
May we have the first question:
TED is real fly, I got a whole lot of dope,
["They've discovered a cure for cancer, but not baldness? What's up with that?"]
even if he had snow on the roof
Like, she's like, why do you have to talk like —
I think we have time for one more.
the different generations of feminists,
as much as you think they do
do whatever you want to do, I don't have any problem with anybody,
For example, in addition to being an activist,
That's how you hold it.
As far as I'm concerned, it's about the love.
Aight? In the future or the present. Yeah.
about the, you know.
it's not just about virtual reality in space.
until we redress the wrongs of the past,
than counting calories,
That said, let's just see who comes out.
But I will continue to consider this idea,
Like, not that there's anything wrong with that,
or hey-we're-not-all-white week,
But I was totally immersed in this world
Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende!
But I'm just saying, if y'all are interested
kind of perspective shift that is happening around the --
or even if melted and disappeared altogether.
when they ask about race or those kinds of things,
I have to think about that.
really represent, like, that you can, like,
I don't got nothing more to say.
which is just, like, a word that I created
I just want to, like, identify myself,
you know what I'm saying, shit going on and everything,
I have me a home. You do too.
Talk like what? Like, I'm expressing myself,
just like, and I was like, what the hell is that?
and I think it's really important that, you know,
So if you want to know more about that,
You are making yourselves and other people miserable.
and getting to come here, hear y'all ideas worth spreading,
in the present, like, I just need to say, like,
How can you be part of the solution?
from the global South, there is this total
I usually just try to use, like, the three little words
That was, like, amazing,
like an obvious choice,
That's what I'm trying to leave behind
is all out of my own personal catalogue,
of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses.
that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants,
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
Okay, maybe it doesn't mean,
not your typical guy.
but maybe it can also not be poison.
And, you know, I'm most popular
kind of thinking about this concept of the future
but she was like, yeah,
for me, it's terrifying to not know what might be coming.
I don't know what's going to happen.
that dream where you don't have any pants on,
all getting interrogated and whatnot.
I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea
you know, I believe in creative commons,
that the present is the new future,
"What has changed now that women run the world?"
So before the present is the new future,
so my name is Joseph Mancuso.
I was like, betch, you know what I'm saying,
as far as feminism was concerned,
and I was just like, please don't say, "Oh my God."
Find it and try to find yourself in there.
without remembering that it is a construct
I don't need to know more. I don't want to know.
because I have really my Chinese identity,
It's like, the separation of church and state.
President Obama has to come up here at the same podium,
I don't think it's required that you have to have
we could talk about the anti-piracy and all that,
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing
bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.
DP: I got to improvise with it, Adam.
Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek?
how it is you do what you do.
when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world
we ask the audience to participate, of course,
(Audience: "Theme of Paganini.")
will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together,
thought that all the world was a piano,
had taken the world by storm.
and someone -- in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in,
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")
This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.
Derek, you can hear every note,
(Music: "Chopsticks")
This one is "English Country Garden."
and even a bit of nose going on in there.
on how Derek got to where he is today.
but perhaps there's time for one encore.
and then was able to play it with the orchestra.
but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then.
DP: For one encore. AO: One encore, yes.
Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play.
I was firmly shoved off.
But in America, they've coined this term,
And in the end, you got so quick,
reproduce those on the keyboard,
Derek can play it on.
AO: Or another one? How about in G minor?
and little Derek concentrating there.
playing the piano for you, Derek,
because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know,
If I just put the microphone down for a bit,
And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much,
And I say, "No, it's not brave at all,
But after a while, I thought, well, the only way
I think that's just fantastic.
was a lot of knuckles and karate chops,
Now that's called perfect pitch,
Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said,
The TED people will kill me,
AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11,
emerged the most fantastic music,
Here's a little picture of Derek going up now,
and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")
DP: "English Country Garden."
you knew instantly what it was,
As you can see, there's me in my early,
AO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking,
I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.
But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.
and that affected your eyes, Derek,
but I thought it would just be nice to recap
Those of you who can see will know how many notes,
And having said to your dad, Nic,
really for the rest of your childhood.
can't really understand much about the world,
because when you played the piano,
And so whenever you heard any note at all --
and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes
were no problem, were they?
without the technique,
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.
out of the loft, never thinking really
Well, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic.
was to press the record button on one of those little
you're invited to come and sing it first,
(Music: "Chopsticks" improvisation)
some sort of musical gift.
AO: Paganini. DP: "The Theme of Paganini."
It's no use having that kind of raw ability
Derek was playing things like this.
So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer
and so there was always a moment of tension
AO: This is Derek the musician.
Can you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note?
And as you can see from the picture,
that anything much would come of it.
as to how I might go about that
while you were playing, Derek.
and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek,
But the orchestra were wowed as well,
But out of all the bashing, after a few months,
AO: It wasn't actually "Cockles and Mussels."
it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.
is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room,
and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back,
maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring,
And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled,
his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny
to play these fantastic pieces.
and then he'll pick it up." (Laughter)
that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.
Would you like to hear me play?
And Nanny's great insight, really,
Derek's going to L.A. soon,
DP: Let Derek play it.
you'd learned the version that you'd learned,
not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing,
DP: Memory. AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do,
if I wasn't allowed near the piano.
AO: Derek, let's have a bow.
in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.
because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod.
was to think, here's a child who can't see.
by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.
You're a fantastic, creative musician,
once we did start learning, you'd let me help you
DP: "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note.
when you were very little, Derek,
that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")
So this is one of Derek's heroes.
But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?
It's the great Art Tatum -- DP: Art Tatum.
and also you had this little habit
But that was the end of the bad news,
and this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage.
AO: A bit like this. DP: Like this. Yes.
you could not only play "Flight of the Bumblebee"
of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing,
So as soon as I tried to get near the piano,
and all that kind of thing.
and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version,
which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?
your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.
I could just play something very quickly
(Music: "Tiger Rag")
but when Derek was born,
has no one in the family who plays an instrument,
because when Derek came home from the hospital,
hour after hour every day that made him think
in the middle of the piano.
DP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this. AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.
learn all the scale fingerings.
You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek.
(Music: "English Country Garden")
and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key,
that things like "Flight of the Bumblebee"
when you were with your nanny.
who was going to look after you, Derek,
AO: You did teach yourself to play,
Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly
DP: "Molly Malone (Cockles and Mussels)."
DP: He played "Chopsticks." AO: And played "Chopsticks."
and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I
and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.
DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes.
perhaps we should get Derek something to play,
And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice
than when we went to Slovenia,
(Music: "Theme of Paganini")
It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me,
And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed
The other wonderful thing about you is memory.
Now, not being able to see meant, of course,
that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate,
and the way you understand the world.
Music must be the thing for Derek.
and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice,
he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.
"the human iPod" for Derek,
that you taught yourself.
pre-marriage days with a brown beard,
and luckily, Derek, you decided that,
Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really
if I just play a random note --
Not only can you say how many notes,
before the rehearsal and the concert,
it sounds like there's three pianos in the room.
AO: -- who also was a pianist who couldn't see,
to him for his first few years of life.
DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose? AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out.
there was quite a lot of body action going on
but Derek, of course, can't.
out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.
In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra,
and actually bashed it,
and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing
early tape recorders that they had,
That was the great eureka moment.
And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds,
Now Nanny's great other insight was to think,
So for example using your thumb under with C major.
because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"
and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest,
you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard,
And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave
as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play
He had to have a lot of oxygen,
Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek,
AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.
and yet he taught himself to play that.
AO: What did you do with it, Derek?
which I think is just missing the point, really,
He was born three and a half months premature,
with the Royal Philharmonic Pops.
in the usual key, but any note I play,
You know, there's this little child who can't see,
Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old,
and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.
when you were four years old.
Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much
and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability
so while we were waiting in the two hours
that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability.
And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on "Tiger Rag."
I think that one of the first things that happened
so whenever Art Tatum plays something,
"Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee'
AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.
and I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really,
And hopefully we can show the audience now
I'm going to play a cluster of notes.
all the pieces in the world that are out there.
operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs
and our position was, books are technology --
but it had a layer of metal that was called "stretched metal."
And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians.
With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.
And then we would size all the other elements --
But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral,
And so this was the final operation,
in order to support their aspirations of the art,
and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map,
It's literally built in a very inexpensive way --
So, we begin by building the cores.
And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.
One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building;
sort of combs, collective programs.
It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building,
but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.
so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.
connect all these things --
We sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient.
second act in arena, and so forth.
in terms of design parameters.
This is it from a distance.
in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.
They inverted the whole idea of development.
I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire.
to a mixed-use building that was very large,
the theater is under construction,
And it concludes in something that you see here,
it's a structural element.
Just lift the entire block,
So this is Louisville's skyline,
the biggest block is what we call the book spiral.
then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.
That skin serves double duty, again, for economics.
This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years,
And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces;
that we've all experienced in public libraries.
So now we're going into what we call the living room.
And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.
I'm going to go very, very quickly through this.
I work with a species called "Bonobo."
we kind of come to understand
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,
You're very happy about this part.
for most of us to be comfortable with.
Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."
It means "star" in Swahili.
carefully tugs to get the scissors back.
Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.
It permeates their entire life.
SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.
and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.
But I don't think that we were that way initially.
Maybe it's something special in his brain
I hope I have a lighter.
I haven't told you that these apes have language.
is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.
To our knowledge they had no music.
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.
Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others,
we want to create an environment in which they have fun,
We're learning how to communicate with them,
He's learning the uses for a fire,
Video: You're happy.
She keeps staring out the window.
Now you have to stay away. Get away.
Their sexual behavior is too human-like
Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle
Panbanisha, like any human mother,
Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?
He's learning about how to keep a fire going.
SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.
He can now cut through tough animal hide.
to perform delicate tasks like this.
he can make much larger, sharper flakes.
Soon she began to write as well.
that allows him to have language.
But he likes to carry things from place to place.
until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.
that they sort of set aside.
and a chimpanzee on your left.
who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,
In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.
Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.
We're learning how to become like them.
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.

Now this shows a Bonobo on your right,

As you can see, there's not a lot of difference
This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required
with another species.
Maybe it's something special in his brain
to a species called the Bonobo.
SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,
Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.

Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.
It's simply to use language around them,
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life
SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.
We divided our world up with lots of categories.
Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.
He has learned that by using both hands

It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,

Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.
SS: I normally talk about language.
Is he looking for where the sound came from?
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.
Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.
These are the rocks Kanzi used
She wasn't forced to learn the piano;

So we're sharing tools and technology and language

None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.
but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do --
SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."

This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.

This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.

"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said,

Now watch out, stay away from them now.
Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.
It's kind of a well-kept secret.
I think we've attributed it to our biology,
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.
Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter,
the Bonobo is a little hairier.

SS (video): We found that the most important thing
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered

And they're learning to become like us.
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,

Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.

SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
What is she writing?
the ability to produce language
which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.
She switches from reverse to forward

How did they develop?

Once you have that capacity,

And I'm happy most of the time,
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired

As they turn toward us you'll see

We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.
We need more sticks, too.
You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?

You can use the lighter to start the fire.
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
And it's used for communication.
We have eight Bonobos.
Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,

I love freedom, but even I agree
they are collecting.
In this case, they've been hacked by their own government.

that they have used the same techniques

making all of us less secure as an outcome.
They all say that this simply isn't true,
that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes
And what this is is that it is wholesale
by their own government.
We did not know about Skywriter --

Well, not exactly everyone,
How big? Well, I can give you the numbers --
that they are not giving backdoor access to their data.
And there's more evidence
and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time,
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon.
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art

Everything is based on the files
And these are examples of the kinds of programs

Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.

Feel free to survey me if that helps.
So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft

So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.

Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.
Backdooring encryption algorithms
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer,
They're about doing surveillance on people
on surveillance by George Orwell,
And this is all the kind of information we are giving away,
and a data storage center.
we knew all this already,
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us,
Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat,
They are not about doing surveillance on people
A real-world equivalent would be that
we should think about Americans as our masters.
George Orwell was an optimist.
You could basically imagine it has a large hall
would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore
We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM.
to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.
You take something which is that good
and to intercept his Internet communications.
and I'll find something incriminating
and we started learning about things like PRISM
is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
Yet we have these files.
and then you weaken it on purpose,
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks

So is one of the parties lying,

That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,

that okay, yes, this might be going on,
and we should fight them,
from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?
Because we have this thing called privacy,
And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this
that some surveillance is fine.
they're trying to find ways around the encryption.
but those small waves together become a tide,
and they discuss it in their slides completely casually,

and when these leaks started,
We should be angry, because this is wrong,
I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.
or they're trying to catch a drug lord
for running this data center
So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.
How many American leaders
for each of the service providers.
This is what they have been told to do:
all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.
such as infiltrating standardization bodies
when they gain access to services like this.
So this is not balanced.
But don't get me wrong:
by somebody called Kimberly from the United States
And the answer is zero.
So once again, we take something which is secure
And if you look back about the forecasts
And one thing we should all understand
and politicians and business leaders

and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself.
or is there some other alternative explanation?
or something embarrassing there in five minutes.
And two minutes later, I got a reply
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum,

And then there's the argument
top secret classified information,

It's not balanced by any means, not even close.

So we are back to the age of colonization,

We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans.

that what I'm sending is none of your business,
challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?
But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job.
and it's rude, and it should not be done.
mostly U.S. intelligence agencies,
and they should be brought back under control.
or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support?
like, you know, "Success,"

In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.
So what do we actually know about the leaks?
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today.
They even have a specific date
and they have leads and they have suspects,
that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings.
that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,
Let's take, for example, Sweden.
you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence.
there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion,

Part of it might be, and there are terrorists,

All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers

Let me share with you today an original discovery.
Narrator: Lynn Verinsky, a professional climber,
So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times.
My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation,
And when I went back to research this, I realized
he made much larger hairs than the gecko,
So watch this kangaroo.
Now that's real time. You can't see anything.
But then as it gets closer to the tree,
And from what I heard from our new president,
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around.
and see what it does with its tail.
that they have leaf-like structures on their toes,
So what they did was they asked us
van der Waals forces.
So of course, in reality, we were then panicked,
And then of course we wondered,
in a tail, with a robot.
And the way it does it, is it takes its tail
So we went, "Oh my god, we have to go to the field,
using a new hierarchical dry adhesive.
with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.
I define that as an association between biology and another discipline,
of Hollywood and science.
And you can also have active tails.
To do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way,
by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous,
Mark Cutkosky, at Stanford --
And this is what we discovered.
Look at the end to see the animal.
Man: This the first time someone has actually climbed with it.
they fall off the wall.
So we did. And here is what it does.
So now we can continue this mutualism
And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response
because there are no reports of it gliding.
and look at the gecko-inspired material.
in designing this incredible robot.
It can also act as a counterbalance.
It can also be used in defense.
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.
But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?
otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
We discovered it. And what we found was
They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone,
in biology, that we wouldn't have thought of.
The engineers had a really good idea.
Engineering can be inspired by biology
And so has my other incredible collaborator,
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it

to something I'm calling biomutualism.
Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing
But of course, this is a passive tail.
So now we were really confused,
that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application.
And you can try this in the lobby,
of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.
we must preserve nature's designs,
to climb up a wall so quickly.
But geckos do it better.
just like we saw in the lab.
They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.
over there, a prototype, with the tail.
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.
that the Stanford group was able to do
Robert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.
And we did that experiment, that you see here.
And it works just like it does in the animal.
It can actually swim through the air.
Now mostly tails limit maneuverability,
when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.
by giving us a hypothesis to test,
nature becomes a much more useful teacher.
had made the first synthetic version.
two of them -- to climb up, and pull herself up.
that they provide static balance.
Now the problem with the robots doing this
And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes
just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.
So then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?"
It actually uses its tail too,
It's a story about beyond biomimetics,
Lynn began her 60-foot ascent.
So for TED we actually built a robot,
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.
This is the actual video -- not staged, a real research video --
That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health,
this kind of thing happens.
You know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.
What they were doing was returning the favor,
when you take a picture of it.
So to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed,
But she actually used these on smooth surfaces --
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive
And perhaps it is most well known
and there was some wind, or we shook it?

And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends.
Narrator: With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope,

my engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley,
And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk,
Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?
or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.
and found a decrement in performance,
we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.
Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.
Robert Full: That's what she did on rough surfaces.
but then integrating that with the best human engineering,

it also does this. Watch this.
professor now at Lewis and Clark,
It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature,
Stay tuned for that.
Lynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance. (Laughter)
"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?"
This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful,
made by Boston Dynamics.
Now, in terms of biomimetics,
We know that you can grab onto things with them.
And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf,
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia.
And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.
Now, being a biologist, I was very curious about this.
And it was unstable without its tail.
that you see in yellow there.
For those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.
not the way I present it in a scientific meeting,
and running them through and obstacle course,
If you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered.
Okay, now we wondered, if we were right,
Definitely moving towards the landing target.
From the simplest version in nature, one branch,

and trying to control a glide.
about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.
Man: How do you know?
And here is what it does.
Even though we put a passive bar there.
And then -- we had to film this several times to believe this --
This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch
so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
and it contributes to stability.
Well we know that tails store fat, for example.
we've talked about an active tail.
And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there.
We wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?"
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.
What we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response.
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened --
It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.

It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg,
And here is the first active tail, in the robot,
Lynn Verinsky: Ha! Wow. And what a privilege that has been.
We said, "Well, what do tails do?"
and explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.
ultimately to make something actually better than nature.
I'm very optimistic. Thank you.
They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."

Oh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.
See that tail? That's incredible!

we got rid of the need to put in really fancy chemistries,
in millions of people every year
And that demarcation that you can see
and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity
We can put those onto a material,
that you would have with the iliac crest harvest?
as an artificial tooth replacement.
and give them a little bit more information.
that in their particular case,
And so one of the things you can think about doing
Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about
and so I had to explain to them very nicely
actually in the case of bone, the matrix
lodged within the eye,
cell regeneration that we would like to have
in the body, in the embryo, as they develop
to want to improve our health and minimize our suffering.
enormous amounts of bone using this approach.
And so some of the things that we're thinking of,
compared to an iliac crest harvest.
And if we think about the different types of tissues
in humans, we all have a layer of stem cells
that's not only super-exciting science,
Those stem cells are really important
can form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,
very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,
put it in there, and we were able to get
let me put it that way, contact that I had,
from different people that were interested in using this.
This was actually used by the Mayans
And actually, the structure of those tissues
much bigger than the cells,
around the cells is beautifully organized
And it actually works really well,
who was a famous ophthalmologist,
was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach
being able to work in this sort of field,
of nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot
and we got many, many contacts
that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.
very often it's been physicians
is actually making scaffolds with slightly different dimensions
100 percent cartilage instead.
That layer is called the periosteum.
And so I'm showing here just two examples
and your outcome may not be very good over time.
You'd put them in the body
So we take that periosteum layer
that we can get the cells to do what we want,
or at least became a famous ophthalmologist.
at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material
in a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry,
because you want blood vessels to grow in there.
beating synchronously on these materials,
your patients might actually have significant pain
and we developed a way to inject underneath it
on whether your patient has any underlying disease,
So it's very, very low in terms of after-pain
and we still need really interesting ways to surround the cells.
of information to the cells.
for pre-planned procedures,
that part of that integration comes from the fact
But the pores are actually oftentimes
but not be so complex as to make it difficult
as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.
And this approach works really well, I think,
And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.
and you can see where that original bone finishes,
was actually from a team of American footballers
And so one of the things we think about a lot
As humans, it's in our nature
and that's a little bit unnatural.
and was punished by the Greek gods.
on the outside of our long bones.
because it was a really nice way
We're actually actively looking for materials
Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab,
which means it's got a really good blood supply.
even the simplest nick and you're going to find it
And that example, I think, is a really nice one,
Our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate,
And if we zoom in again,
that is right next to both the bone
sometimes those contacts are very strange,
This is a histology slide
And I'll talk you through this.
to culture these scaffolds in the lab.
however big or small they are,
and we can then grow that up in the lab
and you can really tailor it.
all of us that work in this field
but we thought about it carefully.
and they use many different types of cells,
And there's a lot of work going on in both of these areas.
because this is a really big clinical problem.
but one common theme that seems to be coming out
of what we see when we do that,
to impact on patients,
but also has the potential
Take, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.
and this is one of the tissues that we work on a lot in our lab.
then you can see the original bone,
or we can put it straight back into the patient.
that will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,
would be pilots coming back from their missions,
other conditions, in terms of how
can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,
and essentially what we see
it's beautifully organized, really beautifully organized.
because it helps remind us that in the early days,
imaging technologies
like cartilage, for example,
and that's a very, very exciting development
to get good clinical outcomes.
and it's got stem cells in it.
But the problem is, there's only so much you can take,
So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,
but it's something you do have to pre-plan.
we've really shifted away from that idea
obviously my own favorite tissue,
of generating new bone,
in that defect site even two years after the operation.
And during World War II, what he would see
and many other properties as well.
so actually now the surgeon can come along,
the structure of the tissues in the body.
and we got rid of the need
Their very purpose was to perform a mechanical function.
So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.
and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans
acts as a very slight point of weakness,
is that actually, very often, those cells will die
in the same sort of state
even if you don't know anything about bone structure,
So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity
is really a great privilege.
but this iliac crest-type approach
is this procedure here, called an iliac crest harvest.
and the periosteum can grow back,
And this led him to propose that material
whether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,
can harvest away that new bone,
But one of the things that's really important
and it was simple materials,
of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans
because they were bioinert.
Now, at the time that we did this,
and we think really hard about designing the materials.
And so you do get these kinds of contacts,
But if we move on and think throughout history
And if we zoom in again, we see that the cells
is that of Sir Harold Ridley,
and those people all come together
but because we used it in a really clever way,

are actually developing materials for that.
all over the world, in all the different labs in the world,
It's hard. It's durable.
is really trying to understand
that sort of strength and toughness in it.
that people are looking at regenerating
And this is an approach that's used all over the world,
people often chose materials
But of course his liver would regenerate every day,
So this was our approach,
so that no other cells from the body can get in,
you're going to use really carefully,
And one of the ways that you can think
the cell might see it more as a slightly curved surface,
their biochemistry, their mechanics,
as the typical tissue-engineering approach.
is very large amounts of bone.
is that obviously stem cells can be many different things,
this received a lot of attention in the press,
One of my favorite examples
and just to the left of that is the new bone
and you're going to need to think about the materials
We've lots of blood vessels in there.
And liver will regenerate in this very nice way,
One other thing I want to quickly mention is that
And I think in many ways we can sort of think
and it's well vascularized,
And that's led to a whole field, really,
We have cells there, typically from the patient.
we put them into has enough information
as a new material for intraocular lenses.
and then they'll dissolve away over time.
that has looked at developing materials

And what we really focused on
They've taken things off the shelf.
is take some bone from your iliac crest,
He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come
Whatever life throws at us,
And an inorganic material would normally be really brittle,
to make lots of new bone.
and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture
and they can form lots of new tissue,
and so we developed a gel that was slightly different
really has a lot of limitations to it,
that might be able to surround your cells in 3D
or even broken bones, we want to try and get better.
how people have used different materials in the body,

and so day after day he was punished

And there's lots and lots of stem cell trials going on worldwide,

then that tissue can start to die,

And bone is actually quite good at repairing.

getting to the location we want them to
there probably wasn't that much in there

including in our lab.
So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that

So for other kinds of operations,

and use it elsewhere in the body.
if we could stop that dead tissue
In fact, when they put it into the jawbone,
And so this is what we did, and the way we did it
and you can actually make it even larger.
that's grown within that bioreactor cavity,
to get quite the right number of cells
many of the scaffolds we make are porous, and they have to be,
you're going to regenerate your tissue,
and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful
so we got rid of a lot of these steps.
We got rid of the need to harvest cells from the patient,
and they want to be many different things,
that actually that material was little shards of plastic
and could we perhaps recreate
and of course, being British
and you wouldn't get an adverse response.
and here we see poor Prometheus,
and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone.
And so our team has chemists,
we still need really interesting topography,
and then transplant that somewhere else in the body.
it has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,
And one of the things that we know is that,
and helps in preventing cataracts.
because it's your own bone,
is quite different, and it's going to really depend
And it's an approach that we call
there's definitely a need for other
in nature and slightly different chemistry,
And we simplified it a lot,
you need a really multi-disciplinary team.
And what I want to show you is that
there's a tremendous need for bone repair, of course,
it could integrate into the jaw,
they'll have their function,
and we can make that material very complex if we want to,
And you can grow different amounts of bone
and it's no longer brittle.
as the first real application
so it really is an on demand sort of procedure.
Now, bone is somewhere in between,
And when you think about designing
using this approach.
that have been quite creative.
depending on how much gel you put in there,
And that layer is actually normally
applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,
You can see here a very squishy one
but also this really rich layer of stem cells.
And it would be really great, actually,
and now a material that's also this hybrid sort of material

And so, here's what's happened in Brazil.
the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means
and everybody agreed, there's a real problem.
The first lesson is that companies are really powerful,

We're talking a lot about this.
So, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.

So, let me tell you this:
The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.

Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green --
You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.

Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.
So, our call to action -- my call to you --
Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.

And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,

So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars

"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow.
And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you
and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.
When Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,
we can reasonably expect from individuals
And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say

And the most important thing you can do, I think,
We've got a climate crisis.
and that matters a lot. This is a story about
that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.
Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy

a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her,

In 2004, I had a little baby boy,
I saw this strange moment where people

Our humanity is actually defined by technology.
That's what technology really wants.

we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.

fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.
And I think once we ask that question
have we ever been where we don't find life.
that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.

and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around
I don't know who needs a corn sheller.
And so the general, long-term trends of evolution
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.
that I began to think about what happens with old technology.
The origins of technology was not in 1829,
is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking,
And so I think that we should embrace technology
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet

Those are all basically the same thing.
that this is a technological system versus a biological system.
and an infinite game is played to keep playing.
They've been around just as long and gone through
So what's happening over time in life is
That is the infinite game. And what technology is
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
And the answer is: all of them.
Imagine Van Gogh being born
opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
I came up with a way of framing the question
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.
the evolution of evolvability.
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.
That's what we're talking about.
what a loss to society there would be.
So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be
I think we come back to life at some point.
to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
That is what we call an "infinite game."
So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,

And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine
So as it expands and as things expand what we have
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
That recursive nature is the infinite game.

All the things that we think that we really like about humanity

where there have been prohibitions against technology,
you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,
just to see what's on life. And if we did that
because lots of the pages are filled with things
And each time we make a new opportunity place,
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,
life means hacking, the game of survival --
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
And again, my question is, what does technology want?
that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
That's the definition. There was no temperature.
What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is
we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life --
every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is
And he was the King of England,
Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities.
And actually, we have current data that does show
what are its inherent trends and biases?
Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page --
because we want those things. Those things are good.
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape
It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.

And so it would be sort of approximately up there,
and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution --

So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,
what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
And so when I think about what technology wants,
I was partly responsible for that cliche
I gave up all of my possessions,
complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,
to the more specific and specialized.
what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,
that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
That's what technology wants.
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago
I can't think of a single general principle of biology
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.

There's currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website.
So I took the 600 summaries that I had,
are you going to spread a thousand ideas?
but give them 10 TEDTalks at the same time
such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style,
I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this.
again, people were able to do it.
I thought, we need to find a solution to this problem.
which is a website where you can post tasks
But it's actually not,
moving toward unhappiness."
But of course, once you are that far, you're not really satisfied.
Because if you do the math, you have a thousand TEDTalks,
So I had 50 overall summaries done.
The obvious question here is,
I mean, when I asked them to summarize the 10 TEDTalks at the same time,
I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway,
So I was almost ready to give up
Or "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."
you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000.
Or some even included references to the speakers,
individual TEDTalks to six words,
Or happiness: "Striving toward happiness =
and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what I did.
While I was pondering this question,
some people really came up with their own version of the truth.
But in the end, amazingly,
And luckily there's a website for that called Mechanical Turk,
So having seen this danger to the economy,
"Found true love, married someone else."
It's downright crazy to have 10 TEDTalks summarized into just six words.
but, I mean, it's already quite a reduction.
"Why the worry? I'd rather wonder."
which is about three Bibles-worth of content.
And if you did this for all thousand TEDTalks,
it's not possible to summarize each TEDTalk individually.
So people on the Internet, some didn't do so well.
so stay even below a hundred dollars for it.
So what if I don't let people summarize
or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them.
which I think is pretty good.
that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.
you would need to do a TEDTalk?
It's what he's basically talking about in those 18 and a half minutes.

Now some of you might actually right now be thinking,

Even then, unfortunately,
He always proves us wrong.
And finally also, I never understood this,
someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick-up line.
but to me they felt a bit bland,
take your whole life and please sum this up into six words, such as these here:
someone summed this up into: "Food shaping body, brains and environment,"
at the value of $99.50:
and you end up with 2.3 million words of TEDTalks,
So I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here
And I would only pay $99.50 --
What's the minimum amount of words
"Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."
by thinking, well, the talks revolve around certain themes.
So I had to find a different method,
which would actually be quite nice.
which I think is a pretty good price.
our intuition is really bad.
Because if you think about it, 1,000 TEDTalks,
For example, when I had a cluster of all the beautiful talks,
The damage to the economy for each one who does this
where people were asked,
For example, for all the TEDTalks around food,

The only question is, how short can you get?
which was pretty good if you haven't seen it:
So I thought of a different way
Because I think you'll agree, they all summarize some aspect of TED,
but not with many friends in the end.
into just 600 summaries,
because that's all he's basically showing us,
I think we have a situation here.
and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately.
Again, there were some misunderstandings.
And I did a little calculation of this.
And I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs
Here are some of my favorites.
a crowd-sourced, six-word summary of a thousand TEDTalks
of about 2,300 words.
but when you look at 600 summaries, it's quite a lot.
which would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content.
For example, Dan Pink's talk on motivation,
I was a bit disappointed.
I would probably end up with a lot of summaries,
I could summarize a thousand TEDTalks
"Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer."
you don't need more than six words for a TEDTalk.
but I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents,
except for me. I don't agree with this.
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars.
They used their six words to talk back to me
over 250 hours to do so.
I actually received meaningful summaries.
Each of those TEDTalks has an average length
and those talks can basically be summed up into just four words,
Actually it sounded nice in the beginning,
surely you can put it into something shorter
So here are some of the results that I received. I think they're quite nice.
and asked people to do summaries of those.
and here you'll see six of the answers --
were the best novel he had ever written.
Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping TEDTalk:
I wanted to have a thousand TEDTalks summarized into just six words --
think that this is quite fantastic --
The challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this,
for each of those 10 TEDTalk clusters that I submitted,
you have a thousand TEDTalks.
and a whole memoir can be put into six words,
And I didn't allow any low-cost countries to work on this,
He's got eight talks online,
I mean, if you have an idea worth spreading,
because some of them will probably be, or are, really bad.
There were others, and I found this quite cheeky.
And unfortunately when I first received the answers --
it would actually currently take you
"with easy solutions around."
and I had 600 six-word summaries for those.
starting out with a thousand TEDTalks.
please take your favorite TEDTalk and put that into six words.
"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"
I would cut my costs by 90 percent.
If you look at the current situation,
I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks.
And I guess many of you here
Isn't there something shorter?
according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com
by watching all those thousand TED videos,
which might be considered a bit strenuous at times.
"People dying," or "People suffering," was also one,
and found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here.
So if a novel can be put into six words
such as "Please summarize this text for me in six words."
I had started out with a thousand TEDTalks
So I started asking all my friends,
you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks,
They just had some general comment.
because I thought the task was a bit harder.
But, oh well. In the end, however,
Here's my approach to it all.
I wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery,
put them into nine groups
Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head
who allegedly said that these six words here:
or the one of Tim Ferriss,
and say, "Please do a six-word summary for that one."
For example, all the courageous TEDTalks:
when one night I played around with these sentences
I actually like that one.

because there's an example by statistics professor, Hans Rosling.

it's going to be embarrassing, but we need to look.
We're mammals, like everybody else
and the molecules they mention
It's all about culture.

and that was the word "pheromone,"

and under its nose, we've put a clean glass rod.
and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you
and work out which ones are really involved.
And it was only in 1959 that a German team,

showing that only the molecule in question

They've got lots of syllables.

They have no smell at all,
If we were any other kind of mammal,
The great apes have these armpits

the molecules are odorless.
in a combinatorial fashion.
and nerve cells that they trigger,
we needed a new word,
Each of us has a unique odor world,

We have to actually demonstrate

That's closing the circle.

Now, this was an inspired choice by Adolf Butenandt and his team,

There is one team that I'm actually very impressed by.
That's the thing which has never been done with humans:
and we'd start looking properly.
What Benoist Schaal and his team developed
that out on the campaign trail for war,
in other parts of the body.
We also need to go back to the ideas
Nobody has gone through systematically
and the Nobel Prize awarded to
in effect, a simple bioassay.
and since 1959, pheromones have been found
is perhaps surprising.
as putting them back on in perfumes,
which is, the great apes have armpits
We need to go back and look systematically
because of the combination of receptors
But it's only 50 years old. It was invented in 1959.
and you'll find they remain less smelly
and when you combine that with white lab coats,
and one of the things we learn
to work out which molecules really are pheromones.
There is actually another reason why we might not
Well, the first thing, of course,
something to make you irresistible
in our search for human pheromones?
and if you don't get it, you won't survive.
So this is a baby having a drink of milk
that we simply don't know at the moment.
and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males
What we need to remember is pheromones
When they're secreted from the glands,
With that new concept,
"That must be something to do with pheromones,"
indeed, that molecule.
but if we could identify the molecule,

and the number of areolar glands she has.
and now put it under the baby's nose,
fantastic science behind this.
of the senses to crack,
all the odors that humans produce --
I'm going to talk about two stories today.
This is my big vision.
I guess I just want you to think about that.
will be happening with road pricing.
and networks are interesting only as they are big.
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.
and I think this is as important and world changing
transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh;
they drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?
with the right pricing we can undo that.
I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane --
we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.
to make all that happen.
within that school, within that village.
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go,
"Let's use fuel-efficient cars."
to completely change how people feel about ridesharing
It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.
And again, do people like the outcome?
I'm launching it in about three weeks --
I think we can get that down to 50 percent.
which is: when are we going to start doing
and when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.
if we choose the right wireless technologies;
Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds
How did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.
Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies
And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?
Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,
What are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise
It means that I pay only for what I need.
There's a huge slack in that system;
It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.
you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate.
But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.
I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act,
implement a gas tax immediately;
Instead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does,
So, I want to move now to the second part of my story,
"Where did you do it?" "In his car."
for something called road pricing.
And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?
they communicate with every single child in the classroom,
we can have resilient nationwide communication systems,
mesh communications device that can be put into those networks,
And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity
or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.
and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.
So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,
Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?
So, here's another example. This company is GoLoco --
the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices --
it could be used around the world very quickly.
you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,
and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today.
the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,
How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?
the only communication system standing was the mesh network.
And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.
How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?
and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street
"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."
These are the next two lines in the movie.
and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.
I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip.
And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems
We could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.
imagine if there was an open-source
so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.
What's the wireless technology we're going to use?
So, let's take control of this nightmare:
And the social benefits:
We've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.
it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it --
So, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?
These laptops, when a child opens them up,
in the transportation sector.
but heaven forbid I would ever maintain
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.
When the hurricane happened,
because there's zero ongoing communications cost.
and we should be charging people for carbon.
driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.
And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.
You can look at the terminal
-- which I know something about --
Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.
Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;
So, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,
-- his fabulous networks --
You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.
and dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.
These things are going to happen.
in order to avert catastrophic effects.
I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.
you know? They like it.
The average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,
And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial
You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.
in every single car across America.
that I can have at my beck and call,
there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight,
So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.
Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.
to reduce their driving behavior.
what mode of travel, where to live and work.
This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.
and require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.
you can have these very low-cost devices.
We have this incredible excess capacity.
So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.
that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,
so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.
or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks --
Information should be free, and access to information should be free,
for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.
And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars
yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.
and open and shut those gates.
or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?
I'm going to give you some examples.
is imagine if we put a mesh-network device
So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.
and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions
those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.
is this incredibly great social event out of their day.
In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on,
provide a new engine for economic growth
gas taxes are going to become road pricing.
but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.
The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members
if the transaction cost was anything.
Where can I go today and who can I do it with?
And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,
"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am."
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.
And this open-source version means that
Thank you. (Applause)
And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.
when we're doing road controlling, road pricing.
video cameras were mesh-enabled
We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent
Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?
and, of course, use mesh networks.
So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London
10 to 15 years for this to happen
and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.
So, the beauty of mesh networks:
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize
Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world
Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."
we are going to do road tolls,
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas
I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour
We need to put this better market feedback.
"I want to say one word to you, just one word."
Another example is in Portsmouth, U.K.
It's not a movie. This is real life.
People adore the company. And it's better,
Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,
When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait
We're transferring just a few little data bits
people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.
Here's another example: in New Orleans,
There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen --
What you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.
We could make billions of dollars on top of it,
So, what is the social result of this?
and is, again, wirelessly enabled.
where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking
And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,
respond to emergencies, get traffic moving,
And for me, as a service provider,
and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.
So again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness
So, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system,
we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.
do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.
What are the incredible weaknesses?
this little slice of things is going to be for free.
but it's an example of something called car sharing.
Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.
and I'm going to be the wise businessman.
require that the mesh be open to all, with open standards;
It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.
This will apply to people across all of America.
One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.
And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,
Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.
And so when I think about the future,
Zero dollars a month.
And why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing,
from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.
and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.
I get all the good stuff and none of the bad.
How do we create a big network?
And if I had my druthers,
The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.
Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world
this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.
One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand
and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.
There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,
Ken Livingstone was reelected.
Why do we travel too much?
mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.
We should pull it forward.
that will result in 50 percent species extinction.
These are also called mesh networks.
Again, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.
that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.
If we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity,
And the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.
If I'm going to go buy some ice cream,
So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.
And what is the cost of that communication system?
Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information
to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.
You guys are going to be the handsome young guy
to our economy as electrification.
The demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.
So you know, when you stick this idea ... (Laughter)
and make that trip much more efficient.
because today we pay for our maintenance
They're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.
And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that
how we can generate a new engine for economic growth
So, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,
You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel,
and for the next 12 months,
All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.

So I want to talk today about money and happiness,
And it ruins their social relationships, in fact.
You don't get any money from that.
So these are sales teams in Belgium.
I'm at a business school, so that's what we do.
And here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about.
and let's make some people give money away,
Compare that to this woman from Uganda.
Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them.
Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me
but in fact, it's Central African Republic.
Human universal -- so you spend money on other people,
we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you
We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could
We see this again and again
Well maybe the reason that money doesn't make us happy
we said, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people.
Or are they negatively correlated?
And basically that if he doesn't show me that it works here,
And we luckily have an opportunity for you.
We had a little natural experiment.
"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on yourself."
What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day?
one guy from Uganda says this.
Above, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.
Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope.
What we see again though
find them and bug them for money.
We let them go about their day. They did whatever they wanted to do.
and fantasizing about what they'd do.
and spend money on themselves,
Huge effect here of Starbucks.
It's good to get gifts for people that you know.
Spend it on one of your teammates this week.
I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is,
but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all,
So some teams, we give people on the team money, they spend it on themselves.
and we do things only for ourselves.
rather than on yourself.
These are only two countries.
We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing.
they put it in their pocket, they don't do anything different than they did before.
even silly things like intramural sports --
So imagine, instead of just people in Canada,
and I can't imagine it would work there.
that don't, in fact, make us happier.
And one of the envelopes had things in it that said,
or targeted toward somebody else.
literally a life-saving donation.
"You know what I would do if I won the lottery ... ?"
So let's have some people do what they usually do
People gave money to homeless people.
Perfectly nice thing to do.
Are they positively correlated? Giving money makes you happy.
But other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro.
and try giving some of it to other people instead.
This is even worse now: "Then I'd have a picture taken
A very silly, trivial thing to do,
And we did the exact same thing as before.
The teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note.
and number two, all of their friends and everyone they've ever met
your personal life, you work life,
Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.
is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves,
and then went back to her room for ... " only cake -- just a piece of cake.
It also, money often makes us feel very selfish
when we're not with the people we know.
What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else
And I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong.
So we went, in fact, to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.
but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy
let's think about the ways we usually spend it
just targeted toward yourself
People who spent money on other people got happier.
This is a real medical need,
I know you're all looking at that red country in the middle.
You can do small, trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this.
everyone instantly started saying,
And we thought, let's make people do it and see what happens.
I drove to the mall in my car, bought a present, gave it to my mom."
And we can see what the relationship is between those two things.
just like we did with the undergrads in Canada.
about which product to buy for yourself
and sipping a glass of champagne."
We asked them how happy they were, and then we gave them an envelope.
and then real cultural differences on what you do as well.
and infiltrated them.
You and I can go on and buy it for them.
We went to a movie, we left early,
Across all of these different contexts --
that money can't buy happiness.
One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece.
or just among wealthy countries.
So the very same purchase,
But enormously different motivations here.
that people who don't give money to charity.
and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that.
is, number one, they spend all the money and go into debt,
So I told you that it ruins people's lives and that their friends bug them.
So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars.
In fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent.
What about your work life, which is where we spend all the rest of our time
how it had made them realize that money doesn't lead to happiness,
what if you were a little more prosocial with your money?
She says, "I bought a present for my mom.
and say, "Spend it however you want on yourself,"
It's in fact, that you should stop thinking
And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier,
because there's human universals on what you do with your money
So we went out and found these dodgeball teams
and we don't have a microscope."
"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.
So you don't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy.
than the teams that only got money for themselves.
and, in fact, they dominate the league by the time they're done.
Because ultimately when you do that, you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more.
So we see it in religions and self-help books,
were things like earrings and makeup.
and they ask them, "How happy are you with your life in general?"
And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves,
but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else.
So it's a very small amount of money, in fact.
people who give money to charity are happier people
is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata,
So what happens when people win the lottery
and, in fact, it made them antisocial.
And we manipulated how much money we gave them.
than keeping it for yourself.
And instead of talking about
We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world
We say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else."
Some teams, we give people on the team some money for themselves
and that's the way to make yourself happier.
that might work a little bit better.
and we approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?"
And what we see is sort of amazing
or "I want a microscope to teach my students science
So people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars.
which is really quite important.
they become different teams
what can I do to benefit other people?"
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase.
So instead of being antisocial with your money,
Well these are college undergrads, so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves
They ask people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?"
And another person wrote, "I would fill a big bathtub with money
where we have this data,
The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there
to say, if you can't show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.
So CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article
This article's about how their lives get ruined.
where people got money
Also inside the envelope was money.
we see that giving money away makes you happier
What we see is that, in fact, the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff
This is a woman from Canada.
as a function of being a member of a team.
that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.
maybe if you spent it differently,
at University of British Columbia
But some people bought a coffee for themselves, the way they usually would,
And then we asked them how happy they are again.
This isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.
so they say, "I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don't have the books,"
in order to make yourself happy,
The teams that we give the money to spend on each other,
was people started commenting on the article, readers of the thing.
if we made people spend more of their money on other people.
What did they spend it on?
They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things.
The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product
So in almost every country in the world
who we give money to make the team a little bit better.
This was a huge criticism that we got
And so many of the comments were exactly of this type,
And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter that much.
Here's a guy from Canada.
So almost everywhere we look
and more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars,
either trying to earn them or trying to increase them.
So look at these two.
which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately.
they do so much better on their teams
So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it,
On one Vancouver morning, we went out on the campus
It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing.
"By 5:00 pm today, spend this money on somebody else."
as the fact that you spend on other people
where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity.
are just the same winning percentages as they were before.
It's an extraordinary thing.
What was interesting about the article
And we thought, I wonder what would happen
"What'd you spend it on, and how happy do you feel now?"
not the world's most representative population.
So we can look and see how well they sell things
you're not spending it right.
and have a little house on top."
and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.
on yourself or other people and describe that."
They had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money."
And you can see, the world is crazily green.
and we've got these prosocial teams
which is amazingly green.
that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about,
But then we see extraordinary differences.
We got data from the Gallup Organization,
But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates,
you're actually just not spending it right.
So the first way that we did this.
of thinking, again, less about "How can I spend money on myself?"
Other people, in the morning, got a slip of paper that said,
It didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them.
and he says at the end that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.
isn't nearly as important
or teams that had this prosocial experience
Other teams, we give them money
The teams that spend money on themselves
than they had before they won the lottery.
We called them up at night and asked them,
Of course, these are undergraduates in Canada --
and try to get them to buy drugs.
And so I'll just say, I think if you think money can't buy happiness
Or in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent money

on what happens to people when they win the lottery.
Just below that to the right is Rwanda though,
which are two things
and in particular, that we're always spending it on ourselves.
Maybe you have something in mind, maybe not.
One person wrote in, "When I win, I'm going to buy my own little mountain
So if you give undergraduates five dollars, it looks like coffee to them
and red means they're negatively correlated.
And then we can see, well now we've got teams that spend on themselves
And I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams.
People who spent money on themselves, nothing happened.
They basically went out on a date,
is that the specific way that you spend on other people
that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket,
maybe bought themselves a coffee,
Go to the website and start yourself on the process
So they have more debt and worse friendships
to see what the relationship is between money and happiness.
They work in teams; they go out and sell to doctors
You actually lose money because it doesn't motivate them to perform any better.
So that's wrong, and, in fact, if you think that,
and measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier.
Describe it. How happy did it make you?"
"I was walking and met a long-time friend
DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit

So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on.
You can make up stories. Maybe it's different there for some reason or another.
is that we're always spending it on the wrong things,
We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to.
when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves.
you're being nice to them.

or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style,
we believe -- and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room --
And so they said, "Well, what's reading then?"
People have this belief -- and I share most of it --
That child was very articulate and showed us
and you had to have these people in teleconference,

You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing,

Well, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom:

Now, that would be, if you will, the top green track,

and typed the command and got it to do what they asked.
That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching
absolutely the most meaningful piece ...
and people don't realize how important that is --
And in fact, it's a powerful educational instrument.
and start talking to that person, then at the person to my right's site,
But let me get rid of the slide,
and you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done."
So we found that that actually was a feature
The two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie

What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child;
We highlight the text as we go through the movie.
it was a very, if you will, architectural or spatial concept.
Each frame of the movie has information about itself.
we actually went so far as to build CRTs
Again, I will go through them as fast as possible.
And the reason it remains a favorite project
Well, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up,
because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction
So all we have is this record. (Laughter)
so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment
we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction.
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar,
if glass was the substrate, which it usually is.
We never succeeded in using ten fingers,
Now, what are some of the other advantages?
And there are just a few slides I want to go through,
but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen
and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads.
X, Y, and Z at least in one direction;
created between your finger and the glass --
but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair

so this slide is a fake slide.
and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing.
I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.

and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you.
Now we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV,
and was really very competent. So it actually meant something.
and there was just too much friction
And the fact that we knew the people --
Narrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see,

And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read,

That's one kind of use of random access.
And it's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen --
The child read beautifully, it turned out,

Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies --
You're going to sort of breathe life into it.
namely, that fingers are a very, very high-resolution input medium.
and they type a little command and -- Poof! -- something happens.
and so this head moves in about two axes.
and the order around the table had to be the same,
it's pressure-sensitive.

but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse,
But it, in some sense, misses the point:
And when you touch it, you have to really push very hard
approximates thinking about thinking.
The next thing that we had to do is to persuade them
where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there,
because that child can't read.
And another advantage, of course, of using fingers is you have 10 of them.
and they got an absolutely ingenuous, wonderful description of Logo.

So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.

It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.

in Arizona or California or Florida
As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary,
What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates,
and that problem started with her
whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?
until you can get home."
and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse
She doesn't need to know that, I figure.
I told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.
asked her to tell me how it made her feel.
I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up.
and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards.
We all need air to breathe.
and quit calling them public places.
when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.
They already felt empowered enough
with body image issues?
What about anyone with body image stuff going on?
according to the gender I was assigned at birth.
And if these politicians ever get their way,
and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good.
to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms.
then let me just appeal
What about people with anxiety issues?
in between classes at their community college,
she came home from school last October
with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her
so that we can all get to work
don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like?
There are a few things that all of us need.
There's no legal or ethical or plausible way
you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer,
I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors.
and you're mostly right.
We need to just admit
and talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away,
that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.
And this starts very early.
at the Halloween party,
from these single stall facilities?
Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth
and that it wasn't right what had happened to her,
does care about the rest of the population.
What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there?
but not for a really long time.
And she had drank two glasses of that red juice
What about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason,
Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools?
She's a self-identified tomboy.
She told me, "Camouflage."
"Until you can get home?"
when you're running upstairs, or you're stretching.
They drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether.
that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day
We can't change the world overnight
as physical exercise?
Would all those people not benefit
I've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about,
supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality,
to make it easier for me to navigate,
And I know what some of you are thinking,
who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes,
if only for just a minute.
And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now
and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee
I know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine.
what a cruel master you can be.
in all public places.
And this is a great and necessary thing,
most of whom are kinda rich
or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip
first when I was just a little baby tomboy
I am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change
They try to legislate to try and force people like myself
One time I asked her what her favorite color was.
that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills.
to escape that world,
And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.
She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem,
If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me,
Fame and money insulates these television star trans people
making the world safer
because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43,
to the part of your heart that probably, hopefully,
then what about women and girls
You know. Love is great, too.
are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed.
And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table,
They exist only to foster fear
and promote transphobia.
from most of the everyday challenges
They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember,
So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened,
with a sign on it that welcomed people like her.
And we all need a safe place to pee.
Trans people and trans issues,
a place to get changed in
We need food to eat. We need shelter and love.
but we can give them a safe and private place
on a very few individuals,
I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days.
So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms
We can't change transphobic minds overnight,
but also universities,
from her half day of preschool
When you get old like me,
they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately.
and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.
They don't make anyone safer.
I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older,
But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.
if I could change the world tomorrow
So today, I would like to talk with you
that goes -- and it can go all the way around.
a way to connect to our nervous system
She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis
So here's Jesse in our first little test with him.
AK: I was able to get four.
Then we fit her with a prosthesis.
then we took the arm nerves
we physically need to do.
like you saw earlier.
So we've developed a small microcomputer
she's using the arm,
and put something in the brain to record signals,
Well we need a neural interface,
to operate robotic limbs.
That's why it's intuitive.
and had both of his arms burnt so badly
Can you tell us how it worked?
because now we're getting to a clinically practical device.
it's a lot harder to do the things
So Amanda came jet-lagged,
let's go to the brain
How do we control them?
where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes
of using just their arm muscles
There is not a learning process.
These are motorized devices
54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire
And you've got one of these conventional arms.
TK: So we're really excited,
with yesterday's theme.
how do we tell these robotic arms what to do?
So we did some experiments
And we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery,
is what we call myoelectric prostheses.
So my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery.
called congenital limb deficiency.
He's just a saint of a man --
Takes about a minute.
with this simple little performance metric.
I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side,
he'll still feel his missing hand.
But at the end of the day,
Can we get more out of it?
and at the same time.
The state of the art
to do targeted reinnervation.
TK: Okay, so I think about nine months later
His name is Jesse Sullivan.
on a World War II vet,
including movable hands.
that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes.
and relatively simple devices.
And that gave us the opportunity
You had to concentrate a whole lot.
and think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?"
to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles.
And we really appreciate you all being here today.
And if I tap the nerve ending
Then we had one of those little surprises in science.
because they're very robust
Arm amputation causes a huge disability.
So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick,
so that it's not worrying about electrode contact.
For 20 years, my goal was to let somebody
to put out on the market and use in a field trial.
And we still use them commonly,
Obviously, that's heavy for Amanda.
and say, "Go there."
that were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes,
This is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.
if we make them good enough
And it now has a hand that can do different grasps.
to pick that up and tell the arm to move.
So we developed a different approach.
if I lost it right here.
When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.
But I can't put in an electrode
and much smoother as he moves these little blocks.
on where we may go with the better mechatronics,
It's all the pattern recognition.
Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma,
And we can use electrodes or antennae
And I was driving home from work,
So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.
for people with arm amputations.
to use now and for my patients today.
which is probably about what my arm would weigh
you can see three different patterns.
you can see that he's much faster
But we want to do better.
TK: All right. So that's exciting
has really good control.
a different section contracts.
so I couldn't just train it anywhere.
And it's just too hard
and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal.
that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain.
He feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,
when he just tried to do three different things,
to get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.
just programmed a little different --
So that was all very exciting.
on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.
So it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.
or bend or straighten your elbow.
AK: Can't clap with this one.
So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.
and he operates little pads in his shoulder
So Amanda, you can see,
You think, "Bend elbow,"
I had to hook it up to a computer,
that are microvolts.
that give us our up-down signals
You touch yourself, there's a stimulus
down to one gram of force.
And here you can see, on Jesse's chest,
We want to develop these little tiny capsules
is our patients have appreciated it.
So that's an exciting laboratory experiment
You open it, these muscles contract.
open and close his hand,
TK: That hand's not so good for clapping.
They work by harnessing shoulder power.
with those three joints,
So Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm?
And thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us
that put out tiny signals
and leave others alone
and a few that I've borrowed from around the world.
two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow.
And your sensation's the exact opposite.
He feels light touch
and get better signals.
And the most important thing
it felt like her finger was rocking.
You squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.
This is what happens when Jesse thinks
So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that.
And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.
AK: It took just about probably three to four hours
but I have a really bright research team.
the stuff of life meets machine.
just from little segments of muscle
out the nerves and to your periphery.
you touch it here, he feels his pinky.
We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago
two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis --
all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier.
because your hand muscles are still there.
And this is what it looks like.
I could work them just by my thoughts.
and let these nerves grow into it.
to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers
that will have a hand that wraps around,
going down your spinal cord,
So you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;
If they did, how would we tell them what to do?
Our functional testing, those little tests,
for people who have just lost their hand,
and you could see strong contractions.
and so all the time you're clapping and singing,
And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.
to get it to change modes.
hundreds of microscopic wires
and deinnervated, if you would, his skin.
that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms,
There's no other functions.
as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.
They work pretty well
because I work with kids,
with a bicycle cable on his right side.
and then I would have to cocontract
And finally, there's a profound social impact.
so the skin was right down to the muscle
And then we used some algorithms
We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.
a wrist rotator and an elbow.
And it provides intuitive control.
But my favorite one was just when the hand was open,
as with the physical disability.
for the science of replacing part of a living organism
but it's really, really hard.
And I also have the hand closed and open.
and recorded this data.
and I had a fine pinch.
refined in World War I and World War II.
We've also had Amanda able to use
which is the popular term
to reaching for something --
is working with really great patients
which were invented just after the Civil War,
to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them.
So for the simple little things like picking something up,
Imagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm,
And I have the wrist flexion and extension.
So rather than a super strong or super fast arm,
There are several available on the market, and here you see a few.
On the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis,
that then she rubbed over different surfaces,
And how did that work for you?
They're called body-powered prostheses,
Jesse came to us at the RIC
because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.
to have something clinically pragmatic to wear.
that is blinking somewhere behind her back
or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there.
coming up and pressing on this new hand skin.
and he felt his missing hand.
We have robotic limbs.
The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high.
There are two general types.
they had to be amputated at the shoulder.
AK: Well, it was a little difficult,
And that's where our goal is --
Imagine sensors in the hand
which means they're too big for five-eighths of the world.
you touch Jesse on his chest,
and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks --
but our little motor's making all kinds of noise
in the U.S. armed services.
with upper-limb prosthetics.
So one of the best parts of my job
with his prosthetic hand.
And after a few months,
You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there,
including over a dozen of our wounded warriors
she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.
So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.
took six more months to have all the reinnervation.
Amanda, how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm?
Unfortunately, we don't do great
so that we can record them from on top of the skin,
so that he might feel what he touches
This arm -- they're always made for the 50th percentile male --
to drive robotic arms.
I've got a real estate problem.
and that was the first time
that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery,
and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand.
And when you lose one, far less both,
about a thousand-fold,
So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics,
AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.
We want to build a better arm.
So we're all motivated to get motor commands
But look at all the electrodes around it.
He has not learned how to do this with the chest.
It goes into that mode,
Todd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up.
Our hands are amazing instruments.
Muscles will amplify the nerve signals
She's carrying all the weight through harnesses.
to try more sensation feedback.
a portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,
which Amanda can now demonstrate.
His brain is thinking about his arm.
(Video) Claudia: Oooooh!
There are also some children who are born without arms,
If it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.
I mean, the functional impairment is clear.
He's about four or five times as fast
because it's not glued on the same.
And we can have the real estate open
because now we have a portal,
came up with this algorithm control,
You can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist.
I want you to watch closely.
There's also a huge emotional impact.
to make their chest go like this.
[be] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way
or, very poignantly, war.
So this is the first man that we tried it on.
ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off.
I can wear it around.
and on the right, it is two months.
And in fact, it feels even heavier,
So this is really exciting for us,
that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom
and we wanted to get more.
And the harder he squeezes -- you see a little black thing in the middle
but your hand and your elbow too.
He also required a revision surgery on his chest.
AK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.
What we do is have the patient go all the way open
motor vehicle collisions
came over into my lane,
with just this little piece on the back.
We're using a biological amplifier
on the left there after eight months of use,
So those are just some of our goals.
Those nerves can put out command signals.
but he can attend to either.
And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time.
You're missing not only these muscles,
are where we put our antennae, or electrodes.
and he did okay by our standards.
TK: So it was a little slow?
with things like industrial accidents,
and a truck was coming the opposite direction,
So now it's able to train
This is our motivation.
You see him with his original device
it's a lot easier making them bigger.
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals,
TK: Okay, this was my goal.
Now you've lost your arm above the elbow.
and those little hash marks
And Jesse's a good crane operator,
to get the elbow to work again.
And fortunately, it worked today.
This was one of our first patients, Chris.
Once we can do it that small,
all in his missing hand,
that we can put into the muscles
And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms
But here's another video that shows some of our challenges.
Well how about with higher levels of amputation?
You can see the movements on his chest,
And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook
that he touches to make the arm go.
and the smartest arm ever made.
AK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural.
use my tricep to get it to open,
Amanda Kitts: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident.
and worked really hard yesterday to fix it.
about how bionics is evolving
It's about seven pounds,
So it'll be the smallest and lightest
TK: A little faster?
to get the hand to close,
And specifically, I'd like to talk with you
where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints
which, by the way, is the same physical arm,
And we interact with the physical world with our hands.
Now you think, "Close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.
so I was able to do that again, which was really good.
than the one you see on my patient.
On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis
We greet with our hands.
but it's made out of commercial components from here down
one is to get rid of my real estate problem
She said that when she just ran it across the table,
It's not a lot different
Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.
We talk with our hands.
how long did it take to use it?
And none of those problems could I have dealt with,
Now this is a research arm,
and my hand simultaneously.
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle
So Amanda, when you first started using this arm,
and just about put on the fire alarm.
with a mechatronic device, or a robot.
of people with above-the-elbow amputations.
TK: Thank you, Amanda.
Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain,
He's had that arm for about 20 months, so he's pretty good with it.
And after six months, the nerves grew in well,
Here you see a patent
some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.
that go down your arm.
Please welcome Amanda Kitts.
to use her individual muscle signals.
We took out a whole circuit in the hotel
with what was initially our primary population
to move little blocks from one box to the other.
of sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable,
and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.
the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.
I was able to use my elbow
I'm still using that old technology
I would have to bend my elbow,
we still have four major nerves
to have Amanda Kitts come and join us.
all by the way she trains it
a converter that sparked.
we're making an arm that is --
probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,
They contain just a hand that will open and close,
and he's using those switches
Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.
and she could feel different textures
that you can record with antennae or electrodes
And after about three months,
dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients
And we're fortunate today
and is operating this
And these are very exciting research areas,
So it was very exciting.
so that it's intuitive, it's natural,
His hand sensation grew into his chest again
So we're really challenged on what we're doing there.
It's like 96 percent.
it emits a little electricity
And actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic
who are also our research collaborators.
There was a computer spook,
or our thought processes
from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm
Every time you contract a muscle,
and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest
I had the key grip, I had a chuck grip,
and everything goes wrong.
the last two years doing that in Paris.
the first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,
and, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.
all at once, in real time.
of 2,500 TGV trains,
Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.
Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars
about the power of the hive,
But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.
and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.
But there are all these other areas that are these profound,
and their different cars, different prices,
We can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people
And Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service
Thank you. (Applause)
that is not my favorite example: insurance.
and you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly,
of a free and open Internet,
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves
for a traditional company.
and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?
and people are working on them in many different sectors,
the owners who are going to provide the cars
I met these founders just weeks after they had launched,
So I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between
throughout dense metropolitan areas
transportation is the center of the hard universe.
that are always participating on these networks.
and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.
It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay,
The reservations start coming in, and here,
who have been making those objects.
Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,
So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now,
and the personal relationships,
And it's not just with transportation, my love,
and 24-hour roadside assistance.
for people to use, by the hour and by the day,
and the result was that we were able to provide owners
Last June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.
Cool guys, excited guys,
And not just easy things that anyone can do.
protection for their own driving records and their own history.
So now I want to take you to the moment of --
as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.
and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,
and supercharging individuals.
I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.
but we actually had this real wow side.
So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,
industrial production and peer production."
that is consistent every single time,
What do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,
and so at the last minute people can --
there's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand,
Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.
in transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,
And for me, when I think about our future,
and here is Selma, who -- I love this driver.
and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,
They need a low deductible,
And the peers also become,
specialization, and all of this aspect about social networks
So over the last decade, we've been reveling in
instead of owning their own cars.
There are many, many examples and I'll give you one
consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse
But I'm thinking, you know, they probably had
and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides
couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,
He said, "We have a community that owns its own company."
building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar,
I know you guys out there who are businesspeople,
When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.
Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years,
Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,
All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial.
and each driver drives about 80 percent less
who are members and eager to drive them.
of the company and the corporation
that are incredibly expensive for companies to do.
Some of my favorite examples:
Industrial production, the whole point of industrial production
and a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent
And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.
and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.
This Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.
different bodies that I have to be thinking about:
that individuals want to participate and innovate on.
to their friends and neighbors.
because they're now paying the full cost,
using industrial production.
and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,
10 people who are in charge of innovation,
and after seven years, last year it delivered
All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.
who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.
the scale is impossible, the urgency is there,
Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies
I see this incredible speed and scale.
530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals
the "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right,
is to provide a standardized, exact service model
that works fabulously.
That is the diversity of what's going on.
Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale
and I'll talk about that later.
and different kinds of minds, and for individuals,
to individuals who add their cars to the network.
and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.
No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them
When you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company,
actually really did happen, and what's that?
and it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"
they figured out early on, we need to have ratings
But what's really happening is that we've got the power
call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us
It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.
And it also delivers really fabulous innovation,
and they're selling it in a marketplace.
All problems come back to transportation for me.
Every single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.
tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions
of people who are creating experiments on this model,
with my husband and youngest child,
with the power of this Peers, Inc. model.
But what does peer production do? Peer production
Some people call this peer-to-peer.
but there's this really fabulous group of things
So this was a trick to get these two sides.
And I can tell you two great stories.
big problems that I know that we can work on,
and so out of all that influence and that effort,
The cars are completely insured during the rental,
So all those months of work, they come into play.
Zipcar buys cars and parks them
It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.
they'd never thought of it before.
And after a year, we have 1,000 cars
to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"
you are having this exceptional amount of innovation
and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?
and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris
So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different
Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.
and its incredible facility to create this platform
What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have
what people would do for five dollars.
significant and long-term resource investment,
and the peers are now in partnership with the company,
And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.
is this completely different way of doing things,
a driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car,
expensive for companies. And what does that deliver?
It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent

That's the easy part, the technology.

I think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure

to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear
How do you do this? How do you solve this problem?
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.
I have a global vision for vision.
The technology is being further developed --
How do you solve this problem?
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself
Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.
I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.
where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.
I'd like to start with a little experiment.
They also have an estimate of around a billion.
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem,
Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.
that we have in the developed world.
I came up with a solution to this problem,
and it's been evolving very slowly.
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.
But the cost has to be brought right down.
How do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?
and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.
or you've had laser refractive surgery?
and that solves the problem.
I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.
In fact, this technology's been evolving.
who live on a dollar a day.
that have some sort of vision correction.
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there,
And that vision is to try to get a billion people
And the answer to that is research.
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now,
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.
and I can see that guy running out there.
wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.
because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?
If you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you.
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
the cost has to be brought down.
You start to get into detail.
The World Health Organization estimates --

Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...
There are about 30,000 in use now.
What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World

Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.
and that's the ratio in the U.K.
I started working on it in 1985,
How do you deal with the industry?
There are just way too few eye care professionals.
And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.

I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.
And as we assemble these tools,
But just go to the Web, YouTube,
I can't tell you how wonderful this is.
And I'm watching your faces,
and that does it consummately well, you can see it can.
Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?

So it wasn't about symmetry.
Because the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere

And also triumph, this sense of transcendence,
The bit that you can't see is the genius that created this.
I'm getting terribly excited
But you're a slave of that first flash.
So we're going to have a little experiment.
Would you mind taking the brain out,
And how much of that reactive side of it
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence.
the slow bit of the brain -- using that.
from the great histories of this stuff.
I remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.
taking the power from the engine.
not through your thinking, but through your feeling.
to switch on the emotional bit.

I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.
You see, using this bit, the thinky bit,
Agusta, Count Agusta,
Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?
The eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused,
Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.
Now I'm going to ask you again
And they're working in beauty
Now I'm not a neuroscientist.
Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it.
Only sometimes. Only sometimes.
I remember it clearly.
It's not a "this is wonderful!"
Look at that picture.
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.
And as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist,
and then to add them into a list
that's universally beautiful.
And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.
I began to ask myself the simple question:
the last physical act.
It's masses and masses of layers.

So it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.

This little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider

And as I took on my career as a designer,
It's the last thing she did,
what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes,
And as he did so, his customer noticed
And all of a sudden, this plastic bag
but it's helping to guide me to the places
It's a fantastic example, a simple object.
This is a more interesting one
or are you going, "That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it.
and so compromises start to fit into it.
and the way I love to come back to it,
I began to think of things in a different way.
But what I have to do now, feeling again,
So I don't know how much this is helping me,
So all hail to that.
Well it obviously isn't.
"No, the movie's about to start,"
and I've got to work with everything else all the time,
But I also know why it's exquisite to me,
so please ignore me.

And when that happens, are you sitting there going,
Some of you, I'm sure, will be familiar with this.

Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here,
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow.

And one of the most tedious ones, I think,
And a focus group cannot do it.
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off,
And it was a physiological response.
It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you

Underneath this, like the story of the swan,

And only a few people can do it.
They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire.
Because I have to know how people react to things.
Now that thing, light flickers across it as you move,
But I felt something.

have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.
and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have --
because, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard,
it all goes away and it folds into this little gap.
to ensure that it gets you there first.
it's how the shapes reflect light.
And because your brain starter motor began there,
and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, I guess.
Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready?
The comprehension of it
that comes out of the tool correctly,
because beauty's incredibly difficult to do.
And you know what those products and services are,
It feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it,
Can we cut down a little bit further,
but this one, because it's a road bike,
but I have to work within that domain,
It's not about the shapes,
Maybe there's an innocence to it.
We're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system --
It's that easy to lose beauty,
And that thing that I found
before cognition, before we can manipulate them --
But how do you feel about it?
I thought, well that's not good enough.
as you walk down it,
I watch what people do.

in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves,
who are picking up something off that.
that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle
So this leads me to think of this in a different way.
No one's going to notice those split lines and changes.
they're arriving at the brain, it would seem,
There's so little compromise on this, you can't see it.
You didn't maybe know it.
It means something triggering a big emotional response,
But what are you doing?
This bit, the big secret of automotive design --
and some slightly engaged-looking ladies
While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you,
so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this,
like that little girl's drawing that I showed you.
Because if I can get that right,
because these are things, as we've already said,
"Why?" And they'd say, "Oh, it feels so natural,"
One of the most early work was done in automotive design --
And I feel that here.
There's some rather bored-looking gentlemen
when they come out of the points?
And as a designer, I can't help meddling with this,
because I know how bloody hard it is to do it.
Or the information's added on at the back,
So that's okay, isn't it?
is the emotional functionality of things.
I felt a sense of relaxation
That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel.
and began to find some exciting things.
So that's getting me excited.
that we see things not as they are, but as we are.
Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes
But they're both different.
I might like it more than you like it,
What I try to pursue now
because he actually is engineer
It's mediated by information before the comprehension.
But then, of course, the consumer says that doesn't really matter.
and I've stopped using words like "function" as a designer.
as well as "Maestro,"
So I started to ask myself questions about it.
So pleasure seems to be tempered
And so I then moved on into my design career
Is it beautiful? Is it exciting?
It's lovely because it is an embodiment
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.
Beautiful? Maybe lesser.
And so I've stopped using words like "form,"
They call him "The Plumber" in Italy,
No time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this.
I'm watching your faces very carefully.
I thought, well what the hell's that about?
There's something weird happening.

I'm feeling it here. I feel it here.
I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects,
And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.
In fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face,
then you can experience this.
this "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new."
Look at that. Do you want to see it again?
that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly.
There's something else in that.
Where are you feeling this?
And the watchmaker turned around and said,

I moved three things by a millimeter.
It's fantastic, isn't it?
In fact, I've never found anybody
That's not the expression of joy.
You probably think, well, I don't know which one you think it is,
Stop. Stop. How do you feel?
that no one will ever see?"
You all, I guess, like me,
This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one,
is a very beautiful thing,
Did you see what I did?
and the mouth is hanging open.
Now you probably know the answer to this already.
Is it beautiful now?
Layer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.

Very hard to find something that, to everybody,
No one's noticed, have they yet?
Form is function. Form is function.

because it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.
It's something much bigger.
And he said to the guy,
but to understand how I can start to assemble things
So how do we make that actually work?
some of you know of it --
I've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.
and if you can actually do this --
in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably,
Well in this case it isn't,
Do we actually think beauty,
This is a beautiful water bottle --
I've had to make a bit of a compromise there.
Do you know what it is? Anyone?
that sensation of what's going on.
means there's something going on underneath it --
of these triggers into something early on in the process,
And the one I showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.

because it's a palimpsest of things.
The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits
It takes a central cortex, if you like,
is an electrochemical party trick
By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things,
because that knowledge is free --
that there was something that did exactly that --
mixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening --
Because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics.
And then somebody, I think it was BMW,

Sensorily, we're taking in all sorts of things --
Why would you do that?

So I have to work with a supply chain, and I've got to work with the technologies,
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside,
And so I did some experiments.
And this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.
And then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator, which is curved.

And what this guy had done:

Now when talking about beauty
I can make them wonderful, and I can make them repeatedly wonderful.

That's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.
Poignancy is a word I love as a designer.
It wins or loses at that point.
The lady over there is actually crying, by the way.
Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.
but at that point, I noticed something happening here.
and by the way, I was little once --
from a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it,
pull it down, "folding T-shirt."
And the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes."

he wondered how, thinking these hallucinations,
On one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,
And if they do mention them to their own doctors
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent
Around 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain,
and whether things like cave art or ornamental art
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"
and this is exactly what you find in some of these people.
or rather, her husband was driving,
and she'd never had a hallucination before.
as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input,

And she said, "People in Eastern dress,
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.
I wonder whether everyone sees things like this,

The things you see can be very complicated indeed.

You smell chestnuts roasting.
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,

I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,
That's why I have one last thing I want to show you.
It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.
There are now, today, so many new funds
Words like "philanthrocapitalism,"
they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.

because often a community forms around these funds,
is looking at this photograph of you.
They're betting a visible competition, a prize,

is talk about the philanthropy of all of us:
the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,
But the ones that do
we're acting our way into a new way of thinking.

as rapidly as possible.
and fast and connected, in service of the long term.
what organized philanthropy is.
to help us especially with things that require
that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands
And this challenges yet another assumption,

It was a black card.
I have a giraffe here.
Audience member 4: Seven.
Is that your signature?
First of all, take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill.
But the important part is after shuffling the cards,
that later, I would realize was actually a secret.
HG: Indeed! It was a high spade.
He took the deck out of the box.
and my answer was ...
Not only that, if instead of using my hand with the fingers,
a number between one and 52.
And my answer was ...
I want you to take the dollar bill,
"I will not touch the deck till the end."
something appeared in the middle of the deck,
Now you can give me the marker back.
Did you feel I influenced you in any decision?
But that's okay, I understand why.
later, I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage
I knew that he was going to touch the deck.
because I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before,
You can shuffle cards in a variety of ways.

Madam, can you take the dollar bill?

You can take some cards and shuffle.
And the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number.
do you have, with you, a United States $1 bill?
And do you mind, can you take some cards and shuffle?
and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand,
all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head:
Before we start, sir, you gave me a dollar bill.
Secrets are important.
Let's make sure you have it.
All the cards in order, just for you.
Audience member: 10 of hearts.
and I don't want you to think,
Since it's a high spade, it could be a nine, a 10,
I have some cards that maybe,

I'd like to start my performance by saying 90 percent of everything is crap.

in my case, the left hand.
HG: I want you to see very clearly
Now, very clearly, I'm going to gather the deck together.
As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it.
Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay?
HG: Indeed! It was the 17.
It starts with a deck of cards onto the table,
an old man and a claim,
Not only that, but I will impose myself a time limit of one second,
something that people used to do around the turn of the century --
Sir, you caught the giraffe.
I have a dollar bill here to explain.
And just like that, very clearly,
The old man turned to me and he said,
Audience member 3: I think so.
I'll give you a clear little example,

it's because we don't place ourselves in a position
Audience member 3: Yes it is.
I believe that amazing things happen all the time.
HG: Three, and after?
"I will not touch the deck till the end."
So after the seven, we have a nine.
"You could pick a red card or a black card."
Audience member 4: Seven. HG: Seven.
And this is the reason why:
And this is the best secret I've ever experienced.
Audience member 4: Four. HG: Four.
Now, I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do.
HG: The king of spades, indeed.
It's called Sturgeon's law, and what that means
and when you have it,
HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!
Now sir, you have the giraffe.

Then it was as if I stepped back and thought
But what I hadn't considered was that inequality exists in prison, too.
Maybe because the prison is in a quite open space.
I went farther inside and I suddenly saw inmates moving across the corridors.
They didn't write fluently, either.
One of them once said: "In prison you never sleep.

that someone applauded them for something they had done.
I remember a verse by a tremendous poet, a great poet,

it hides the speed of existence
And so I said that to start this workshop,
We decided that they were going to write a book.
that can never be taken away when they write
and they told me they wanted to put on paper
The heart fights among the swamps,
That was at the end of 2010.

Then, we doubled the bet and wrote another book.
That was our simple party.
And we started to read, and we'd read one author, then another author,
In prison there are things that can't be done.
So we started looking for short poems.
Martín Bustamante: The heart chews tears of time;
Very short, but very powerful.
When the first year of the workshop had ended,
they learned that they could make the walls invisible,
They had no idea such dignity could come from them.

So we started appropriating that hell;

There are words that are virtually forbidden, like the word "time,"

That moment made me think a lot

new rules that made them understand very quickly,
we plunged ourselves, headfirst, into the seventh circle.
They recognize themselves, they look at themselves in the poem
Not only did they write a book, but they also bound it themselves.
Seagulls fly overhead, and you feel like you're next to the sea,
and by reading such short poems, they all began to realize
It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back.

Thank you very much!
At the workshop, in that beloved hell we share, we all give something.
They also suggested to me

I figured there would be a minimum of 700 points
and about a year and a half after that,
into maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men
and as I do, at the end of each one of these terrible, terrible dates,
I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract,
For 900 points, I'd agree to go out on a date,

I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online.

He made a lot of really interesting cultural references.
So I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates
So I call my mom, I call my sister, I call my grandmother.
These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers.
Well, as it turns out, there is an algorithm for love.
I wanted somebody who worked hard,
the voice, the communication style
I was the most popular person online.
And most importantly,
I am totally down with splitting the bill.
so I was looking for somebody
Well, not too long after that, I found this guy, Thevenin,
I figure about half of that are men,
Three weeks later, we met up in person

And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered
the number of times a man forced me to high-five him.
And as it turns out, content matters a lot.
I regale them with the details.
and feel free to be as picky as you want.
I had a conversation again with my grandmother,
I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted
that wanted to take me out on lots of dates --
The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets,
And as it turns out, lots and lots of men wanted to date me.
I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody.
and it's 2 o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake,
I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978.

But I didn't want everybody's data.
So needless to say, I was not having a good night.
as you'll soon find.
I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,
It looks like you did come up with a really, really great system.
I'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36,
He talked in detail about travel.
These algorithms had a sea full of men
or I could try online dating.
and that's really just a simple way of saying
You've got to date around.
that people now meet each other,
and when he dropped me back off at my house that night
that came burning down in a spectacular fashion.
Now, before I lose all of you --
and so I agreed to go out with him.
And as it turns out, timing is also really, really important.
Now, there was one small catch.
And as it happens, the algorithms that were setting us up,
what turned out to be truly awful dates.
because it's predicated on an algorithm,
because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate
words like "fun" and "girl" and "love."
I figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months
and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure
that I could possibly date
The other problem is that these websites are asking us

In fact, it's something that you write yourself.
So I didn't reach out to any woman first.

that was being used to match me up with other people,
So that wasn't going to work.

which, to be fair, is a lot.
Who are all of the other women on these dating sites?

And the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be.
Margaret Heffernan: Fantastic research, Sandrine.
And what we've known already for very long,
So here we have a sample of diet --
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol -- will decrease neurogenesis.
I now eat a lot of blueberries.

For example, I was talking to one of my colleagues, Robert,
Yes, you are right, it will increase the production of new neurons.

And this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis.

So Robert, you know, being the good doctor that he is,

This fear, getting outside the man box,
I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.
He was home alone a lot.
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.
But I've got to tell you, we young guys,
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."
He told me to go in his room.
And as we were preparing
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.

what we come to know as manhood.
And out of my own frustration
as this fear that we have as men,
and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
and come back and talk to me
he burst out crying.
Now I expected him to say something like,
His grandmother had two jobs.
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.
that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,
I think back to my father.
something I just can't even imagine.
I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."
He said to me, "I would be free."
"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:
and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.
to view them as property and the objects of men.
Now I also want to say, without a doubt,
just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
and definitely no fear;
Why are you crying?"
it was about two hours outside of the city.
He was about 16 years old,
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.
this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.

Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.
He was being raised by his grandmother.

Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.
Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.

and the burial was in a place called Long Island,
and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.
Because for me growing up at that time,

So quickly, I'd like to just say,
in front of all the players,

Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.
I would say to myself,
We lived in New York City, as I said.
and at the same time, he was also giving me props,
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"
I would find myself saying things like,
And the limousine empties out.
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
Two things: One, I never had sex.
So when I go in the room, I close the door.
And I said to myself,
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."
I walk out into the room,

I remember asking a nine-year-old boy,
that men had to be tough, had to be strong,
that's just straight up twisted,
I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?

Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome.
And so that is something
So I went there in 2007,
but not quite as big.
JA: I'm not sure about the incident.
and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.
and how you came to do this.
JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.
The material looks good, it feels right,
are spending economic effort into concealing,
Bradley Manning, arrested,
bringing this important light.
create secrecy around your sources?
we need to move, time now!
I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization,
a short clip from this
personally identifying information in it.
not from the official media, but indirectly,
So information that organizations
We don't know, but what can we do?
of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened?
you have to, yourself,
Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
CA: Here's -- We're going to just show
that has sort of personal --
And there's a lot of information.
"Look, we're skeptical about this thing.
still is the richest man -- in Kenya.
CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.
and ran into the authorities early on.
against the inevitable legal and political attacks.
We have a way of dealing with information
So under that basis, we put it out and said,
there is another way of nurturing victims,
who was the richest man --
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.
If we can have this document up ...
you were also a hacker at an early age
and then defend ourselves
But do you see any irony in the fact that,
who will deal with the highest national security stuff,
And how do you secure their privacy?
package of legislation for Iceland
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.
CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short --
a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
what sort of information
and used it for political leverage on Moi,
but this is not necessarily connected.
So late last year -- in November last year --
Can you give us a sense of what they are
you leaked a few years ago.
CA: And you were also -- I mean,
release it to the public
in order to have people
while we're re-engineering our back systems
we put together a new sort of
JA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents
JA: Thank you, Chris. (CA: Thank you.)
and some other international legal experts,

an unintended consequence?
Is it really yours?"
around President Kibaki's neck.
who wrote it and knew what it was about.
a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy,
JA: So this is a sample of what we do
So let's take [an] example, actually.
and killing people rescuing the wounded.
I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.
and all power to you.
So this is just the first of three attacks
as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.
working with Icelandic politicians
CA: Wow, so your leak
became a dead albatross
We couldn't verify it because we didn't know
to further research that story.
which changed the result of the election.
That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next?
so it was an extremely difficult document for us.
I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?
JA: What, the movie business?
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad
that that should never happen again,
according to a Kenyan intelligence report,
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?
Instead, they publicized your side.
had nothing on the top of it,
vet it like a regular news organization, format it --
CA: So you found a way to shine light
And we were like, "Oh, tell us more.
we can shift it one way or the other.
whose son is out serving the U.S. military,
JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment,
CA: But are there risks with that,
with obtaining 150,000 cables
Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked,
and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer
because with just a little bit of effort,
and/or the funding of journalistic salaries?
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV,
that have been in my life.
about five days ago,
We have to try better. Let's show them another example.
in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.
You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street,
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in --
CA: So, what was the impact of that?
basically journalistic volunteers
It's a worry -- isn't it? -- that the rest of the world's media
You're clear. All right. Firing.
made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.
ran into trouble with a bank,
we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki,
He was a soft dictator of Kenya.
He has been charged,
CA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.
it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia
but we're presumably acting in such a way
It will change the perception and opinion
CA: So that's the key bottleneck,
this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.
Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?
for all that time, as a filler,
the true human-rights abuses in those governments.
JA: We have denied receiving those cables.
then we destroy that information as soon as possible.
That's what they see every day.
And just a month ago,
Can that possibly be true?
I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ...
Well, we just show the website instead,
wanting to track down the source --
And so it came in from the outside.

Arab governments are like,
from some rival, various competing oil firms
but don't have enough people to actually
than the rest of the world's media combined.
that are really sort of well-motivated.
"This has never happened before. What do we do?"
that know it from the inside out,
what happened in Iceland?
Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled
I mean there's like -- there's a method
that actually caused the outrage, do you think?
JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business
like Sweden and Belgium
of a very high caliber
but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward
This is like one of our methods
and the news reader was like,
because the organizations that know it best,
the national election, December 28.
So you have to be careful with hacker.
What was the key element of this
and transparency legislation around the world --
pass it through legal jurisdictions
This is -- this is intense material, I should warn you.
That's happened quite a lot though.
like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk,
and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya,
there's a hope of it doing some good --
just prior to the election --
a sort of engineering analysis into what happened --
well, capable, generous men
to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,
and that means we're getting enormous quantity
but here's a short clip.
five minutes before it went on air,
that when the information gets out,
and we managed to get hold of this
to have leaked this video to you,
almost never know who the identity of the source is?
CA: And releasing this caused
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption
Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.
the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan --
The video itself is longer,
And the national TV station was injuncted
that's a really good signal
JA: Yeah. (CA: Because?)
Dangerous troublemaker.
JA: Not really. I mean, we don't have
to get information to us.
But remember, the people in Baghdad,
we are sort of overwhelmed
with the strongest journalistic protections in the world,
Baghdad airstrike video.
But there are legitimate secrets --
and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.
JA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?)
JA: So this is the Kroll Report.
the documents are legitimate,
and we have a number of ways for them
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.
It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.
like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico,
JA: Well, I was a journalist.
CA: So you make an effort to ensure
two young children were wounded.
CA: So help us understand a bit about you personally
or it's just all to be played for either way?
classical whistleblowers,
What would you say to that?
Anyway, so we release this report
which is to police perpetrators
that helped determine them?
CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst,
You know, hero -- people's hero --
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees,
and then lower security cases.
JA: So these are -- as far as we can tell --
Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?"
to sort of become an offshore haven
in the Microsoft Word ID.
of the rest of the economy.
word of the report leaked into Kenya,
there was a series of well blowouts
and maybe some incident in your life
of WikiLeaks and of Julian.
including two Reuters employees?
that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.
for the phenomenal public interest that we have.
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP
because that's their full-time job.
You know, there might be a couple of views
CA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right,
to millions of people around the world
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.
that occurred in that scene.
How do people release the documents?
That gives the impression, has given the impression,
Iceland went through this financial crisis.
JA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world,
so I'm not actually so big on the nurture,
And then the government sat on it
so we have to restructure
do you think it's more likely to be
CA: How does it work?
Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n.
JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.
on this and an associated report.
When you think of the future then,
than the rest of the world press combined.
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?
to encourage leaking of secret information?
I'm a combative person,
spent about two million pounds
you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account,
looking for any excuse to do so --
CA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far --
which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do,
that is hard to grow very quickly
Last question, Julian.
of that type of information
you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.
JA: Yeah. And you know,
they commissioned this report,
CA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think
for a TED membership.
CA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion
I mean, we're an organization
is able to release more
we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.
either to the individuals concerned
I mean, in general, what's your philosophy?
And the engineering report
they nurture victims?
to clean up corruption in Kenya --
but I think for TED you are.
CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is
firing 30-millimeter cannon shells
to continue our mission, not to screw it up.
that's a recipe for breeding paranoia.
JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.
that a little group of activists
shifted the vote by 10 percent,
was injuncted from running the story.
the man that he was going to clean out,
CA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this.
CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims;
through a coalition of forces that were trying
CA: I mean, a psychologist might say
JA: The impact on the people who worked on it
and that's our hope.
is doing such a bad job
Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.
went to Iceland and spoke about this issue.
saying, "Hey, we want to track down the source."
had decided to pal up with
that's the sort of material that's there.
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
And when Kibaki got into power --
the regular postal mail,
of the people who are paying for it all,
and we became very famous in Iceland,
and that's what the history of journalism is.
If you look at declassified cables,
(Phone ring) God damn it.
We get information in the mail,
And what would you say to, for example,
CA: Yeah. Have you had information
And that's what we've found in practice,
had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.
and something from other capable, generous men
the gross disparity in force.
so the combination between the two ...
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see.
CA: So they are well-motivated.
is to try and get these guys to write letters.
You basically published something there,
When we released that report,
And that's something from my father
JA: Oh, come on. There must be some.
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see
Should they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us,
and then on the run from a cult,
between China and the United States.
to enact those legal protections.
God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em.
they nurture victims.
and if we find out at some stage
Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on?
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.
so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.
Radio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up.

saying that, in fact, security guards
do not create victims;
classified U.S. embassy cables.
Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view?
We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.
they see it every day.
Iceland's a Nordic country,
has released more classified documents
CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story:
after its election in 2004.
JA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know,
they don't need to see the video;
for freedom of speech.
JA: Well, because these sort of things
commissioned by the Kenyan government
Who's got the hero view?
was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.

you went to 37 different schools.
to harmonize freedom of speech legislation
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby,
you know, your records with your doctor;
JA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian
And we then got a letter
And we got a report --
But the core values:
And I think I read that as a kid
This gave them the peace of mind to move forward.

From this experience I'm going to share five practices.

You're going to need caregivers.
It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.
RS: I always come back to variations of the question
It seems to me that's the fuel that's driven a lot of this.
You have six months or a year to live."
and I've found, very interestingly enough, that nobody wants it for free.
instead of just filling out the little items of whether you're the right person.
And then when we finally have time, we have neither the money nor the health.
So this is not a simple business.
There is no other question.
Make sure we are the bride you thought we were
and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it.
Slowly we went to a process where we'd say things like,
Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day, talk to anybody you want.
No one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world
this is what you don't say,
hundreds of millions of dollars of business
From your point of view the evidence is there,
So you say, "Here's a great program that, in less than one generation --"
What I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this,
which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours.
is use the little tool, which is ask three whys in a row.
So maybe we'll start charging for it and then it will go somewhere.
And so we said, look, the retirement,

They've invited me. I've always been scared to go.
that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups
I call them my terminal days.
we need the directors to do more.
And follow this all the time and we know how they're doing
who are 25 percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore.
So the process is looking for wisdom.
So there's a place for music and literature, etc.,
So our board had two seats open with the same voting rights,
and we started dealing with this very issue.
And then, in this same vein,

As this information started coming to people,
I hope that with this, and that's what I'm wishing you,
And we looked at that and we said, we have to start much earlier.
when you think about the opposite of work,
which is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.

And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent of a grade, they don't stay,
It is one thing to say, we need to recycle the teachers,
We started three new companies in the last two years.
oh, so now you have this time, these terminal days,
And we put together people, including people who like education,
but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer
how much people make somewhere else in a similar business
So there's a place for math and physics and all that there.
Every Monday and Thursday, I'm going use my terminal days.
what the margins are, and so forth.
So let's give people these three pieces of information.
And so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting,
does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands.
where there's Google and all these technological options.
and thankfully one of them has retired.
And then, they have the power,
and Lumiar says the following:
We know nothing about love,
But very few of us have learned
So we started saying things like,
Chris Anderson: So Ricardo, you're kind of crazy.
Until we know they're 37 percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue,
How do we express ourselves?
So we started having, in the cafeteria,
whatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news.
we said things like, we don't want to see your expense report,
Let's set up a system and put lots of money into it
I freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever.
It's a very crowded thing that we do.
The opposite of work is idleness.
Do you have any other questions for us, for TED, for this group here?
So there's a whole thing of having the courage now --
I've gone to the magnetic North Pole on a dog sled.
RS: They don't even have the incentive.
And hopefully, as a result of that, and over time,
and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things.
and I ended up, one day, at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.
But very few of us know what to do with idleness.
we don't want to know how many holidays you're taking,
because the little you know compared to Google, we don't want to know.
so that we're not playing school, they really decide.
what they make in benefits, what the company makes,
And some people would say,
So we bring them to school and we say,
but we're not any closer to the age of wisdom.
I've spent 59 days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu.
And in the process, of course, we wanted people to know everything,
if they haven't been interviewed and approved
The second why, it starts getting difficult.
Don't tell us where you are.
And try, any one of you, using 3.1416 for something.
And over time, we started asking other questions.
which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties.
You're running a company with a 90-day mandate.
And I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you,
So this is lost and that's what we try to do there,
And so the courses are World Cup Soccer, or building a bicycle.
And the fact is that they kept us honest.
And the guy says, "Get out of here."
this is so good you've got to do this.
How we design, how do we organize, for more wisdom?
except they're theirs.
You go play golf and tennis, and you meet people,
How do we help you move these ideas forward?
A tutor, in the old sense of the Greek "paideia": Look after the kid.
RS: I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come.
there's a dramatic increase in performance.
And more, even when we had thousands of people, 5,000 people,
So we started asking questions one by one.
So when you spend time in a company, in a bureaucracy, in an organization
so the six-year-old kid who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,
This will find its own place.
So we started thinking about that as a company for the last 30 years.
There's only three things you need to know:
boy, I wish I had spent more time at the office?
I'm now working on getting this school system for free out into the world,
Going from a math class, to biology, to 14th-century France is very silly.
Things like, how do we measure ourselves as humans?
But the fact is that, leisure is a very busy thing.
which means, they can and do suspend and expel kids
It's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum
we know nothing about death,
My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,
And you say, ah, I need some leisure time, and so forth.
How am I supposed to work? Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?
how much people make inside the company,
CA: What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound.
And I will do, during those days,
And I'm afraid of the other one, which says,
So over the years, we started going into other things.
which has instead of 43 out of 100, as their rating, as their grades,
And then, come back.
On Mondays and Thursdays, I learn how to die.
And I kept thinking, one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor
which is many times situational, as you know.
why do we want to know what time you came to work,
And this is 25 years ago.
And people will sign up for a 45-day course on building a bicycle.
Part of it will be wrong, and it doesn't matter.
The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.
And so, the question we were asking was, how can we be taking care of people?
We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out
Ebola was relatively ignored
This leaves little in the way of market incentives
Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now?
And make no mistake about it -- it's not a question of "if," but "when."
Clearly, there is something deeply rooted about it,
because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases.
We've known what it's capable of.
The child's symptoms begin
As for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all,
and what type of reactions they promote.
we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases.
And so, that's the clue.
we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development
That is actually twice the number of people
We've had ample opportunity to study it
If you're thinking this is Ebola,
And vaccines are our best defense.
are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines.
followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries,
Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola,
As for measles, so much in the news recently,
It goes something like this:
more than other diseases.
so the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now,
But wait a second, why is that?
as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.
when all of a sudden, people perceived Ebola
So these are the things that can be done,
as epidemic infectious diseases.
to understand the geographic and genetic diversity,
actually, in this case, it's not.
is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear.
Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point?
in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.
there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers.
until September 11 and the anthrax attacks,
and kills 22,000 people each year.
which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine,
for more than a decade.
to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain
with mild fever, headache, muscle pains,
led the global community to come together,
for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks
and they're going to threaten the world.
and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind.
And we need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent --
the death toll is actually tenfold higher.
Well, partially, because it was really difficult --
It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars
We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it.
which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens.
Fortunately for diseases like Ebola,
So we rightfully fear Ebola,
but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines.
the paranoid fear of an infectious disease,
which are the diseases that most threaten us.
with vaccine development for infectious diseases.
unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries.
We've known about Ebola since 1976.
Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure.
and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies,
something which scares us and fascinates us
something we make sure is available,
but if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high.
to take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine.
Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science.
or thought to be difficult -- to weaponize the virus,
And in fact, we've actually had vaccine candidates available now
we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy.
And yet, we spend virtually nothing
The people most at risk for these diseases
In that case, if we want vaccines,
And this is really the point.
So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola,
then bleeding from the mouth, nose and gums.
Every year, we spend billions of dollars,
These bugs are going to continue to evolve
for manufacturers to develop vaccines,
but at the same time, praying we never have to use it.
which then can be used to help us understand
In fact, it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles.
to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen.
We have to stop waiting until we see evidence
Vaccine development is expensive and complicated.
We may have it someday.

By creating capabilities within countries, we then create the ability
It's simply too commercially risky.
but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it.
The data from that then can be used
that have been killed by Ebola
in the nearly four decades that we've known about it.
Because right now, we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available.
but to do this, if we want to deal with a complete market failure,
Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries --
and in stockpile creation.
It's an extreme form of dengue fever, a mosquito-born disease
not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people,
We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola.
how these are being changed immunologically,
The sad reality is, we develop vaccines
it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear.
of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one.
The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure.
When my brother called me in December of 1998,
And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,
of the mean of the patients that actually decided
tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,
Because something went different.
it for more than two years.
And even though Steven passed away three years ago
that they can go back and they can engage the medical system?
But you know, a lot of people dropped out,
put the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,
to become human again,
These stories of his life, converted to data.
Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,
We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.
And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing
this understanding, this ability to convert
But here is the answer
unable to breathe and move, over this time journey.
"Given my status, what is the best outcome

and I never really knew.
and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.
And here he is, paralyzed completely,
and go to something more.
I want to talk to the 58 patients down here
Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data
and filled out the IRBs and did all this work,
because we began a journey
on cognition, vision, walking, sensation.
And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power
that are doing this social experiment with us.
I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.
that he has non-genetic ALS.
And he sent me this two days ago.
1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.
His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired
Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.
And he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes,
So, you click down on the ALS tab there.
The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,
This has actually been, to me, a gift,
matched the controls exactly. Exactly.
Here is an M.S. patient.
There are so many other people sharing their stories.
of what a record is.
And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,
So, this is what happened when PNAS published this.
sharing their stories as data.
No one's ever had this kind of information.
but he is not alone.
You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.
So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,
I want to talk about it in the context of a story.
This amazing data allows us to drill down and see
I never really knew whether it worked.
where we went back and engaged the medical care system.
So, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.
and go beyond just this simple model
and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.
You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.
we found her, she was odd because she had data
and then his hands, speak,
Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients,
it doesn't work very well.
and you can drill down and see the individuals.
cannot move, cannot speak.
I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.
But almost all the time it works.
I'd like to show it in real time, now,
Because, as we all know here today,
to someone that cannot breathe,
going forward, and then going backward.
Now, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.
as a builder: taller, stronger,
which was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.
Can we find out what's going to happen to you,
These are patients currently on drugs,
So, we went from this story of Steven
"Can we match them with our time machine
from the start of lithium at time zero,
the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.
that we can look at in any way we want to understand it,

We let them share the data and exchange it.
and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life --
And he took lithium, and he went down the line.
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time.
and so what we do, this concept we had,

But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.
that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial --

And this is the insight, the thing that we are
And that's what is going to happen to Humberto,
integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,
they are all stories.
And here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.

in healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.
We looked at this and we said, "We're going to do something with this

which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.
So, the patients print it out,

to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,
when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,
So, we line them all up so they go together
an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on
but I can say whether it works in Humberto.
There's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,
I actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group --
the trial, there is too much drop out.
to which we can begin to change the way
helped me answer the question about whether
He renovated my carriage house
in which they're meaningful.
And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?"
as he was in that pool, he could not walk,
I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,
Here's the implication of what happens.
I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.
Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,
that for those 69 people that took lithium,
You can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.
those stories into something that is computable,
from that drug all integrated in the time
years after my brother had died,
but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.
I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"
And they call the Internet irresponsible.
So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,
This is a report about a drug called lithium.
or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you
Each of them can have a different characteristic.
I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects

I can't believe that these people,
all of his prescription drugs,

Here is the schedule of how frequently they -- it's a dose.
the amazing things they've done.
that if you did it at a higher dose
Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.
So, how can we take this and bring them a tool
but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
So, can I take this data -- rearrange yourself,
There is an amazing journey we are going on
I can look at my constipation, how to manage it.
And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring
but the rest of them are really what's important here.
You scroll down in this profile and you can see
So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."
It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?
These are why people pray.
You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about
So, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you
This is about the patients.

So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man

But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.
What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.
I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science
So, patients have this. We're for patients.
And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.
I've got to thank the 45,000 people
That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time

So, Steven is sharing this story,

so that you can maybe change it?"
can you guys tell us whether this works or not?"
I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,
is that people always accuse these Internet sites
So, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.
and his history to data, and then back to paper,

I am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist,

When this happened, a part of me thought, well,
We haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain,
which according to its label helps reduce stress,
the marketers came calling.
If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it,
I'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.
So what we found was, when tryptophan was low,

but also the products you see on the shelves.
and showed them videos of ringing iPhones.
and even maybe to make us better and smarter.
it's just a news story.
The point here is, when you see activation in the insula,
and they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.
because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.
Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that

These scans, the clinics say, can help
from a single brain scan.
and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection,
("Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?
And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.

Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning,
just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.
So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans

You've probably heard of it.
That's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines

There's something called BOLD imaging,
But we have this combination
a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish.
That was not what was going on.
And I think there's some sub-questions there that I put there.
The fact that we do it over and over again
something called "trading fours,"
Now the way that's done is by the following.
over the next 10, 20, 30 years
Were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising?
♫ Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity ♫
And so the experiment really rests on the following:

CL: Okay. So I'm going to stop that there. So what do we see in his brain?
It sends out what's called a MIDI signal --
just a little better than I wrote it.
They don't know what's coming, but they'll hear something off the cuff.
And for me, this sort of deep and enduring fascination with sound
we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood
♫ Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike ♫
If you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same,
As I like to say, these are not the "jazz areas" of the brain.

Rap, of course, rap --
they will get cued different words.
it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument.
and we're measuring blood flow, not neural activity --

how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate
that say science has to catch up to art,
and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left, the lower-left --
And so what you're seeing here --
we now have the means to take a musical process and study it.
CL: So again, it's an incredible thing that's taking place.
and so, as a form of intense creativity,
but I think it's very viable.
the science of innovation,
you'll actually see real, meaningful studies
♫ I'm passing on fashion; you can see how I'm dressed ♫
There's not too many brain-dead people creating art.
And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH,
CL: At this point, I'll take a few moments.
And so through this piano keyboard,
and he'll never play it exactly the same way again,
And it works like this -- this doesn't actually produce any sound.
This is the main method that I use. This is called functional MRI.
And my colleagues kind of think I'm crazy,
we talked a lot about innovation today --
Now when I think about improvisation and the language, well what's next?
And I think hopefully in the next 10, 20 years
meaning that it's a product of the brain.
And then there's the bottom one, which is called the jazz paradigm.
CL: Okay, so it works.
♫ [unclear] boxes [unclear] hip hop ♫
off the top of his head,
I will say though that, after having done surgery a lot,
♫ Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete ♫
I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this.
that went way down in activity, and I'll summarize that for you here.
So how do you study rap scientifically?
but I will say that, from a scientific perspective --
so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully.
but musically really boring.
of real, honest-to-God musical interplay, for sure.
And he'll improvise entire concerts
so that you're not inhibited, so that you're willing to make mistakes,
And fundamentally that's what I do in my lab.
that jazz used to serve.
and we're just getting all the data together,
scientifically very safe,
of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level.
and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs
I guarantee you that will never happen again.
One area turns on, and a big area shuts off,
just ask a lot of questions.
In a lot a ways, rap serves the same social function
Maybe we're not the right people to do it.
And so we've done this actually on eight subjects now,
But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius, neurologically,
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically,
quarter notes, metronome, right hand --
♫ Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic ♫
that would contribute to any artifact
that "I really want you to be creative during surgery,"
with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration.
you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe.
and I myself, I'm not going to give you many answers today,
I think in different time periods.
Why should scientists study creativity?
that much music, spontaneously?
And then there's improvising on a scale --
♫ Not really though, 'cause I've got to keep it simple ♫
have minimal interference
in local blood to that area
is that, to be creative,
This is the control condition. This is what they memorized.
have many more questions than answers,
There are, in fact, a lot of correlations between the two forms of music
And so it brings the second question:
How can the brain generate that much information,
And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser
be magnetically safe,
That blood flow causes an increase
was memorize this lower-left sound icon, please.
I think that neuroscientists
between what takes place in free-style rap and jazz.
and to miss the whole point of the music.
well maybe there's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all,
So just to conclude, we've got a lot of questions to ask,
I think -- how can this possibly be?
Emmanuel: ♫ Top of the beat with no repeat ♫
I'm going to start off by playing a video for you.
and suck out your blood? That's awful, right?
of contracting a killer disease like malaria
And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.
That awful buzzing sound at night around your ears
Why? Because they are just like the CIA.
and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever.
to find people that carry the parasite.
In fact, it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture
that drives you absolutely crazy?
with several hundred hungry
some of us are just more attractive than others.
We tried, with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese,
but we undertook some remarkable experiments
stink more than she does.
And so we set up another crazy experiment,
and three hours later what we see at the bottom
And we found some remarkable differences.
My second story is remarkable as well.
that the dogs can find these people,
That's right. (Applause)
in a world without malaria. Thank you. (Applause)
that I'm just about to release. (Laughter)
And since we all smell different and produce chemicals
what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used,
Here in this box I have a cage
we have swapped the cards with mosquitos.
a child dies of malaria, and Paul Levy this morning,
because we collected the smell of these larvae,
On the left here you see the bites
And so we started focusing on the smell of feet,
First, we observed that not all mosquito species
we can treat them with anti-malarial drugs, and give the final blow to malaria.
But perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps,
put it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable.
on the smell of human feet,
When they fly into our bedroom at night,
had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person,
and now he's locking into that smell,
That means that in a population where malaria
through a simple mosquito bite.
In that pool of water, these larvae are concentrated.
and, I should say, has never been shown to the public until today.
So we set up an experiment
and has been shown there to be two to three times
Mosquitos. I hate them.
that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell.
until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature
except that what I'm showing you on the video
Now let me show you how this works.
on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos,
how can we resolve this problem? Until we realized
It's about man's best friend. It's about dogs.
how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria.
My third story is perhaps even more remarkable,
he was talking about the metaphor of the 727 crashing into the United States.
the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field,
but he's coming back to the first one,
Now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing,
They're all together there. They are immobile.
And last year we thought very, very hard,
That's the cheese, just to show you.
because they're called mosqui-toes, you see? (Laughter)
and bite people and transmit disease.
more attractive to mosquitos than humans.
It's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae.
and when I take it with water,
in a very large area, everyone would take these drugs,
Now think of what we can do with this.
In contrast, the African malarial mosquito
and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole.
throughout the landscape, all these pools of water
which means that now we can use dogs
whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage,
One of the best ways of killing mosquitos
Because half the world's population runs the risk
of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania
Since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites
and I will show you how quickly they will bite.
He's going back to check the control holes again,
Man's best friend in the fight against malaria.
And better still, imagine what would happen if,
and in that cage we released mosquitos
by sniffing us out. They smell us.
Either way, mosquitos find us in the dark
They had a very strong preference for biting on the face.
has gone down all the way, and there's few people remaining with parasites,
malaria as a disease.
African malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night.
In fact, people have told me that now they will enjoy
they prefer to bite my wife.
that said that cheese smells after feet
she's convinced that we can train dogs
Every 30 seconds, somewhere on this planet,
bait it with our smell, we may be able to stop transmission
to that pool and you can kill them there, right?
I have right here in my pocket,
blood meal, I'm shaking them off, and we follow them through time
and that of course we should have known all along
We can actually use this to contain outbreaks
when it gets to mosquitos.
But that's fascinating, right?
This lady is Ellen van der Zweep. She's one of the best dog-trainers in the world,
to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides.
with the larvae, they are scattered all over the place,
which smells badly after feet,
is not to wait until they fly around like adults
They can't escape from that water. They can't fly.
to see where they were biting on the body of that person.
I'm going to show you exactly the same thing,
And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment.
Have a look. That doesn't work. Okay. Sorry about that.
That's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing,
but especially for her, so that she can grow up
So cheese, dogs and a pill to kill mosquitos.
Don't worry, I do this all the time in the lab.
Knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin
of the cage is dead mosquitos,
and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria.

very dead mosquitos, and I'm going to say, ladies and gentlemen,
And the question of course is, what would make someone
And you know what? It worked.
being bitten by mosquitos.
Just kidding, just kidding.
smell different compared to people that are uninfected,
because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin,
Here we have a bar with four holes,
So my wife smells nicer than I do, or I just
bite on the same part of the body. Strange.
for the betterment of mankind,
He's examining these holes, and now he's got it already.
It's a crazy story, but I believe it's perhaps the best
Now, on the video, on the video here,
that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed.
And therefore, we set up various experiments.
with these inspectors to much better find
by the Dutch malarial mosquito on this person.
And they're accessible. You can actually walk up
They don't kill us. We kill them.
That would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate
What I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it
to attract African malaria mosquitos.
Maastricht, be prepared.
And during my Ph.D, I wanted to know exactly
Well, in Africa, we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s
and she believes that we can do a lot more.
Why did we set up these experiments?
as it is now used in the fight against malaria.
of mosquito-born diseases, of epidemics, right?
So the problem that we face with this is that,
And this was not going to be an easy task.
I'm sticking in my arm, I'm giving them a big juicy
It's a tablet, a simple tablet,
Ooh, that was very quick.
And there's a whole range of compounds that they do use.
that just like us, we have a unique smell,
which makes it very hard for an inspector like this
And the answer is smell, the smell of her body.
Why does she receive more bites than I do?
In fact, there's only one good thing I can think of
Limburg, be proud of your cheese,
enjoy being bitten by mosquitos?
to see these mosquitos get very, very sick indeed,
incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity
we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.
voice-based tests are non-expert.
and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,
Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise
you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.
We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.
in combination with the latest in machine learning,
and using precision voice analysis software
and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit
we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,
using voice signals alone.
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.
So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.
TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones
TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.
Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,
and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,
So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,
gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,
and we can make population-scale screening
So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today
So what that means is that people will be able to —
Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,
I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.
So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.
as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,
in the neurologist's clinic to do it.
From the sound, we can actually track
and ultimately, the only way we're going to know
who have the disease, and they have to live with
We need to be able to measure progression objectively,
Thank you. (Applause)
So, well, I do applied math,
to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.
feasible for the first time.
to detect the disease before it's too late.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,
because, you see, in one sense, at least,
so too are the vocal organs.
you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?
six percent of our target just in eight hours.
in different circumstances that matter because then
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.
for anyone who does applied math, is that
in which we can try to achieve this,
and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,
But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease
No one knows what the hell we do.
and this is a peculiar problem
But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected
We have the opportunity to start to search
and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?
this 20-minute neurologist test.
They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters
have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.
irregular vocal fold tremor.
They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.
on a continuum between health and disease
Takes about $300, by the way,
because he's done some fantastic work,
which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.
ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.
That means they can be self-administered.
However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide
Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease
And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,
to record a very large number of voices worldwide
so there's no simple blood test that you can do,
Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.
TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.
and that means that, outside the clinical trials,
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers
we are like management consultants.
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.
because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs
So, taking the first steps towards this today,
to try and explain to you what I do.
so what we need are objective tools
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.
expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.
and looking for the actual markers of the disease.
it becomes massively scalable.
from all different circumstances, and it's getting it
for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.
No expensive staff time required.
an objective measure that can answer that for sure.
of a billion people on the planet.
which is very advanced by now,
We see all the same symptoms.
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy
a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.
So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of
you will see later on.
during the call you have to indicate whether or not
ML: It's much better than that.
You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,
in some cases, but with any digital microphone,
we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies
and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,
record their voice, and then their doctor can check up
we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.
and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,
after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.
The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,
and the best that we have is like
and leave recordings, a few cents each,
TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?
And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.
that may well have a genetic component to it.
the vocal fold position as it vibrates,
What are you going to get out of those samples?
let's say, 10,000 people,
When something becomes ultra-low cost,
Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,
and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,
when we make sounds, and we all actually
ML: Thanks, Tom. (Applause)

What happens? It rings.
Imagine you take a bell,

Now, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe

We've mapped the afterglow
looking at the detailed structure of the night sky,
and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.

And those small, little, inhomogeneities,
It's now 2.7 degrees.

Over here, it's a little hotter,

Now, we've mapped that afterglow

But the really crazy idea
But if you wait, that ringing fades
For good reasons, we thought we'd never see
So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper --

This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,

and that's not what they found on Monday;
that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that.

But early on, when the universe was making

Now, that early universe was incredibly dense,
If you look deep into the night sky,

So here's what they found on Monday:

I think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.
although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.
That's often the advantage of time.
I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy."
People love that shared connection that gets created
in people who use tools like GPS,
and they could do the same thing.
And I realized, this is it.
And she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month,

They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,

We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,
You don't need human assistants for that anymore.
For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,
I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s
than it's ever been in human history,
That doesn't work. That's just annoying.
The advantage of volume, first,
And of course I said yes, for several reasons.
The things we know are still important.
Watson does not travel.
And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,
they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.'
And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.

that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."
There's a weird sense of mastery you get
when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.
So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."
to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.
There's so much information out there.
I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.
this was a terrifying idea to me.
I don't have to learn new things anymore."
I have read that there's now actually evidence
It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy,"
and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore,
People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program
as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.
I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.
I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced
Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."
And when the game eventually happened about a year later,
The third reason I said yes
So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.
I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.
I came to believe there were two advantages
In two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary
And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.
not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.
And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.
and that this is actually something ominous,
if you have all these things at your fingertips.
So me and the other human player
I studied computers because I heard that was the thing,
wound up at this secret IBM research lab
There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.
Watson's actually huge.
one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time --
I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share
I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s
who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,
unpack the meaning of the clue.
thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.
But then you see the line start to go up.
You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.
I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979
In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,
physically shrinks and atrophies
we're going to be able to make informed decisions.
If you watch the news, you'll see occasionally --
As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,
we'll enter a new golden age of leisure
But if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.
If you can't do that first step,
And I would do it for nothing.
enough to get the ball rolling.
having poured millions of dollars into this
where there was only one English language TV channel.
I started to get occasional updates from them,
And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background --
These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants
And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.
reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of "Simpsons" episodes
And it hasn't been the last.
normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.
when we'll all have time for the things we really love
No, every day we should be striving to learn something new.
It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.
You say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah."
I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score
and I started to get a little more worried.
but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.
And thought, what are these?
because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.
not an especially good one,
It's doubling every 18 months now.
This was the first I'd heard of it.
some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.
as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.
This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make
And so I sold out way too young.
Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.
But they were right. They were exactly right.
Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.
and I know just a little something about it,
Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,
cheering on their little darling,
with whatever great fact I had just read about --
about many different kinds of facts.
that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically
I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.
was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,
If we have those facts at our mental fingertips,
One, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.
and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,
Things always go terribly wrong.
and I became a computer programmer --
Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?
And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.
because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.
I'm sure many of you remember a distant time
I never had a guidance counselor
It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.
Now when facts come in handy like that --
Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?
and the lyrics of Abba songs.
They say that the scope of human information
that used to bind our civilization together.
I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.
as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,
over somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."
hoping against hope that the humans screw up,
And given "Jeopardy's" average demographics,
You're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.
I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,
under this new regime of thinking computers.
and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,
And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power --
It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.
On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age
that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.
For the most part, they are just normal folks
There was Armed Forces TV,
who don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,
that thought you could major in trivia
where information is more universally available
The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,
it was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.
People playing computers on game shows
things don't always end well.
The other issue is the advantage of time that you have
It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.
And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart
I didn't try to figure out what one does with that.
are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know
Now it's really not possible
it's an unpleasant sight.
It's not the Terminator's gun sight;
because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,
It's a meeting or job interview or first date
of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.
I mean, nine years is a long time.
and I see this all the time --
I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.
Samuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."
Or your alma mater or your job,
And I remember standing there behind the podium
and says, "Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."
And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.
If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,
We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.
A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?
seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.
that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads
he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea
There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.
or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.
This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.
These are the decisions that require correct judgments
Are you up for this?"
it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,
All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.
sitting on a mountain somewhere,
It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in "2001."
And so Watson does not travel.
and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.
as the humans they're replacing,
And you'll make a less informed decision.
or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.
I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,
when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.
the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.
we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,
But not all, a few are still alive.
But in this case it happened in real life.
and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,
that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud,
and "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."
I was not going to say no.
But that's what I was doing.
or "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime.
when "Jeopardy" came back on the air,
that those of us who have these things in our head have

and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person
This is one of the newest things we've been able to visualize
we also leave traces of our microbial DNA

and then right down at the bottom, we have the fecal community in brown.
So instead of trying to identify them visually,

And what's more, we're starting to do clinical trials with more children
So one day after you do that transplant,

Over on the other side, we have the skin community in blue,
So this is really remarkable, right?

Why this happens is absolutely amazing, though.
Now, it's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect

We humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies,
it turns out that not everyone wants to know.

Now, although that might sound impressive,

So what we're looking at is each point represents one microbial community

So what we are going to look at
So microbes are performing a huge range of functions.
you have this radical change in the gut community.
and the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin
They help us resist disease,

for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome.
which allows you to claim a place for yourself on this microbial map.

So babies that come out the regular way,

although there's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut,

So, for example, what microbes you have in your gut
We're just finding out that microbes have implications

the differences week to week are much greater
It turns out that everyone's anecdotal experience out camping is actually true.

What my lab does is develop computational techniques that allow us

Well, one thing we can do is we can raise some mice

you probably have some dark suspicions about that,
But I'm guessing that many of you do,
and turn them into something that's a bit more useful as a map,

to figure out whether this has a protective effect generally.
it becomes fatter than if it got them from a regular mouse.
and by the time he reaches day 838,
and see what happens.
And then in mice, we can do a lot more.
we sequence the DNA of their microbes and then release the results back to them.
What it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body
So why might we want to do this?
by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice
Different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms
So how we're born has a tremendous effect on what microbes we have initially,
from one body site of one healthy volunteer.
And what we can see is that just over these few weeks,
in health associated with Cesarean birth,
without any microbes of their own in a germ-free bubble.
So this is incredible when you think about it.
When we take the microbes from an obese mouse
so they're taking more energy from their food,
So you might be wondering whether we can also do this sort of thing across species,
and they've also now, just over the past few years,
but we haven't always been that good at figuring out what's important.
we can also match you up to your dog.

They help educate our immune system.
So does what we do early on, where the microbiome is changing so rapidly,
but at two years old, she hasn't had an ear infection yet,
that prevents them from gaining this weight.
And this might be associated with some of the differences
in the same body habitat, either.
So if I look at just one person's microbes
and so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same horror
but maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out. (Laughter)
All the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope.
which are very important,

Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans
So slowly I began to realize that what started out

because these drugs actually don't work all that well.
So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing
which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.
Now, an emerging view
What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge
is to try to come up with some general characteristics
And what we found is that if we gave these flies
what gene is affected in the mutation.
Remarkably, the answer is yes.
we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain
So how do we ask this question?
And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all
We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies

but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?

Now, how far does this analogy go?

But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons

and it seems to keep getting irritated.

Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.
that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,
in your immediate family or circle of friends
and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked
But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities

This view is conditioned by the fact

What that tells us is that dopamine

Well it turns out that the computer analogy

And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.
And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,

Rather, it's acting to control two different functions

or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.
More puffs, or more intense puffs,

And the water flows through the city with time.
into different, very normative ideas.
or even worse, if you ask me.
I think, something that art, in a sense,
moving was the only way you could see the pavilion.
It's very much about the way we link
and who is the receiver.
as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas,
doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.
It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.
which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.
If you have a waterfall in there,
And your body somehow knows that.
And suddenly it makes a difference
She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.
Iceland, lower right corner, my favorite place.
The why meant really,
A sort of a run track, or a walk track,
Since two years now, with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin,
a kind of a temporal pavilion where
is to kind of move the border of who is the author,
If you stand still, the landscape
to that is interesting:
parliamentary ideas, democracy, public space,
Having an experience is taking part in the world.
So you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment.
has been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other
It's very much about this causality, consequences.
So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements,
I also feel that I can change the space.
not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better,
And I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.
"Oh! That was my foot there!"
The show was, in a sense, about that.
why, rather than how?
A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top,
Or is that a three-hour hike, or is that a whole day I'm looking at?"
This whole idea of a city not being a picture is,
with the Serpentine Gallery:
what the potential is, obviously,
And it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful,
So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.
as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.
Adding a measurement
Experience is about responsibility.
I think it raises great things about
that space has dimensions. A space has time.
Because I think it makes a difference
if there is a dimension I could call time,
and what the space, in that sense, is.
I would say yes. It is obviously about
because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere.
and to collectivity.
as she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror.
So just keep looking. Don't mind me.
This is the Tate Modern in London.
It's made out of ice.
"Is that a one-hour valley?
Of course the political agendas in the world
That's all I have. Thank you very much.
If I take a stand, it makes a difference."
And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London,
I have occasional meetings with scientists.
and just keep looking there --
but it obviously looks really rather frightening.
And as you come to a new valley,
wants to seem as big as possible.
So, asked in that way,
Do you see when I said in the beginning, it's about
And why would we want to do that?
between what your body can embrace,
if I feel there is time,
which is both sensitive to individuality
But look at her face there,
The difference between thinking and doing.
a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.
Who decides what reality is?
in this city, as they walk by,
an attempt to make a car.
And if you stop again, you wonder,
particularly right now.
by overlapping what I say and what you say --
And if I vote it makes a difference.
will change the color of your horizon.
it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by --
But nevertheless, what the potential is --
The green dye is not environmentally dangerous,
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.
I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.
What does the word "public" mean today anyway?
Do you mind looking, with me, at that little cross in the center there?
It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension.
into two different opposites?
obviously that there is a discrepancy
if I feel that the space is tangible,
and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference?
playing around with the sense of space, you could say that New York
And experience is not just
How do we know that being in a space makes a difference?
The small mountains in the foreground, they move more.
filter into a sense of responsibility?"
It makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.
So the movement with your legs
create a kind of a space
In the studio we do a lot of experiments.
in a museum. Right? That's how museums are working today.
in, kind of, moving that border.
it was really about showing people,
One is an experiment I did for BMW,
without polarizing the two
in the world in which we're moving into,
This whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality
With such a big space, the problem is
If a waterfall is falling faster,
So if I have a sense of the space,
Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative.
It's quite simple and fundamental.
that has had an interest in somehow
How do we create public space?
I would say, there is experience.
How do we reconfigure it?
The big mountains far away, they move less.
So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities.
whether you do something or not.
have proven that one can
Of course they have to look through a bloody camera
how we do things, but why we do things.
"And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.
the time it takes for water to fall.
It's about being together.
And right in-between thinking and doing,
I think there is a socializing dimension
These are ongoing experiments.
I think holds an incredible relevance
And my idea was to make the space tangible.
Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference
which is made of colored glass, going all around.
And you go, "My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall."
Is there a sense of consequences?
in the times we're living in now,
which is down there in this snow, just last weekend.
So look at this. Look at the girl.
in L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo,
The "Green river," as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition,
The moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.
the lower East River is this big."
I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back.
there is one thing about falling water which is very much about
Of course being an iconic city like New York,
community, collectivity.
So what is between thinking and doing?
how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?
an idea which is both tolerant to individuality,
So art, in that sense,
"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"
the city negotiable, tangible.
on the top of a museum in Denmark,
let me cue on here --
where we produce the film together.
like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river
Life in Space is really not necessarily about
and who has responsibility for what one sees?
in these different places of the world.
I also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.
And "Ha-ha, there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter?"
I would claim that art and culture,
and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting
And what happens is that people, they start to see themselves in this space.
The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship
This summer, in New York:
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.
the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case
"What does it matter?"
The water has an ability to make
and you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly."
and that is called Life in Space.
These kinds of experiments, they filter into architectural models.
rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture.
In summer you go swimming.
And the principal says
right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten.
And the leg washing place -- there are many kinds of water taps.
So you have to consider safety.
and they need to tumble sometimes.
They tried to go in.
And each classroom has at least one skylight.
they learn to help each other.
The sand is 50 degrees.
But if you look at this,
the boy is not washing his boots,
So, children are supposed to be outside.
The driver in front, she needs to learn how to drive.
The boy on the branch,
But of course, rope has nothing to do with them.
They are supposed to help teachers.
And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas.
And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail.
you want to spray water to your friends,
and the one in front is quite normal.
But he insisted: "How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof?
But the surprise is yet to come.
And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning.
The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average.
between 9:10 and 9:30.
This kindergarten is completely open, most of the year.
Sometimes 40 children are around a tree.
This is the annex building,
"Of course you have to have a handrail."
I didn't put him in.
You know, it's completely open.
if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room,
The principal of this kindergarten said,
among many kindergartens.
Thank you very much.
It's a natural process.
we are trying to make everything under control.
And there are always some trees in the classroom.
And also, you should know that you are waterproof.
You know that children sleep better in noise.
You are not supposed to be in silence.
But here, just they leave and come back.
It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof.
This is how the rooftop looks.
And you know, our kind grew up in the jungle with noise.
But in this kindergarten,
He will come back eventually, because it's a circle, it comes back.
you know that kids love to keep making circles.
And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children.
It looks so nice from underneath.
So that it can catch the children falling off?"
And that makes them learn
not only underneath the roof.
Because there is no boundary.
And there is no boundary between inside and outside.
They fall into the net.
When you put many children in a quiet box,
kids need a small dosage of danger.
And of course, the government official said,
And the circumference of this building is 183 meters.
he loves the tree so he is eating the tree.
I said, "It's impossible."
So it means basically this architecture is a roof.
he's putting water into his boots.
And these children have the highest athletic abilities
we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter.
And also there is no boundary between classrooms.
So that is how we should treat them.
So it's not exactly small at all.
And then we put other children.
They talk to each other around the well.
You see with the flexible tubes,
He is resilient. It's my son.
This is society. This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days.
don't protect them too much,
We made this kindergarten to be a circle.
Now, this drawing is showing the movement of a boy
And if the roof is too high, you see only the ceiling.
The building is only five meters tall with seven floors.
There are three trees popping through.
This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007.
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above.
"No, I don't want a handrail."
usually children try to hide somewhere.
And you should know that
And of course, the ceiling height is very low.
there is no reason they get nervous.
I think architecture is capable of changing this world,
these children show amazing concentration in class.
they sit on the edge.
because we wanted to see children on top of the roof,
I said, "It's impossible."
My point is don't control them,
And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off.
And why did we design this?
And we made the roof as low as possible,
But we could keep that idea around the trees.
They don't sleep in a quiet space.
And secondly, we consider noise very important.
The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo, as you know.
some of them get really nervous.
This is how they divide classrooms.
And you know, you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar.
He's okay. His skull is quite strong.
But the point is, in that kind of occasion,
So, we put our children, a daughter and a son.
"I don't train them. We leave them on top of the roof.
You never melt in rain.
with their architectural objects, I do a series of
and flashing through it with some action.
to feel that I was able to express my own voice,
Just, let me slow down here. Fancy having eight -- (Laughter)
Just for a second, think about that word "TED" in front of
yeah blah blah blah blah, we go into the duet, yeah,
Throw it into the audience again.
with the technology of the body.
where I've fixed the routine in my head
They're starting it already, and this is a task-based method,
Kick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom.
TED dance, three versions of physical thinking. (Applause)
And I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed
It has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do
that might move them, touch them,
Creativity for me is something that's absolutely critical,
as well as in body, and it's a collaborative process.
So basically I'm going to make a duet.
We've got mental architecture, we're sharing it,
you can do this with your eyes closed, or open, and if you
Okay? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, world premiere,
and we're all experts in physical thinking.
I'm just working on my task. My task is this "T."
anthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists,
and I'm just going to take this letter "T," the letter "E,"
Yeah? Okay? Cat, almost get his head. Almost get his head.
and these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it.
Here we go, ready? And ... bam, bake ... (clicks metronome)
and I think it's something that you can teach.
all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee,
I now decide where I'm going to be in that space,
the kinetic sense of the movement,
the ways in which we think about things more generally?
I think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have,
Imagine that there's a circle in front of you, yeah?
They're constructing that phrase.
I want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina.
into the real world, so just imagine that word "TED"
of the letter "E," and I'm thinking about it, and I'm imagining
for themselves about what to make.
I feel like I've got something to say and something to share.
Here we go. (Applause)
my own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach
So good. So -- (Applause)
where the ends of your fingers are
and shared, and I think you can find out things
don't want to do it you can watch them, it's up to you.
then you become really very aware of your bodies.
so what they are, are just pure lines.
about watching it, about encouraging others
It's a bit of a cross of my arm.
Okay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing.
or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it.
So I'd like us just to do, we're going to do a little
about how it is that they're moving.
Some dancers, when they're watching action,
The duet starts. (Clicks metronome)
I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
If I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down
So from there, from there, we're both getting up,
with an outside mental architecture that I work with
to a local dance studio, and I had an enlightened teacher
I'm going to think about it in 3D space. So now,
Underneath. Jump. Paolo, kick. Don't care where. Kick.
So, maybe too much. So, here we go, ready, and -- (Clicks metronome)
to imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in
Okay, you've got something? One more thing.
very simply, where you take one idea from a body,
who allowed me to make up my own and invent
You're both getting up. Here we go. Good, now? Them.
help them think differently about things.
turn her, whoo-aa. (Snaps) Great.
take the overall shape, the arc of the movement,
use your weight to put it back up,
So just keep working on them for a little second.
I'll just be doing it.
to participate in it,
And we all know what that body is like in the real world,
If this, if that happens -- " I've got lots of methods like that,
Separate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front.
I was born in the 1970s, and John Travolta was big
my own dances, so what she did was let me make up
you, so it's in mind, and it's there right in front of your mind.
vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices
So for me, choreography is very much a process
So just have a little watch about how they're, how they're
Yeah, down to the floor. Can you go underneath?
Whoaa. Just after it, maybe. Whoaa, whaaay, ooh.
Some work very much in specific detail.
But what's important about it is how it is that they're
If I already then said about that space that you're in,
So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.
So we're starting to build a phrase.
I'm going to zone in on the "E," and I'm going to
It gives me something to do, something to work towards.
so what I'd love you to do is imagine,
I want you to think about them as architectural objects,
on the floor, here, maybe just off the floor,
The one you made. (Clicks metronome)
I work often with designers and visual artists,
Here it comes, Cat. (Clicks metronome)
I'm not remembering what I'm doing.
They're using the information that they receive
They absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go,
so I'm down on this small part of the bottom rib
about your own personal physical signature,
of physical thinking. It's very much in mind,
Okay, let's have a little go from the beginning of that.
What I thought we would do today a little bit is
Kick, replace, change a leg. Kick, replace, change the leg.
Can you place that down into the floor?
where they have the autonomy to make
So -- three versions. (Applause) Oh. (Laughs)
they're going to snapshot it, they're going to take
I move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them:
Let me just see that a little bit. Ready, and go.
It's something that I have to do with other people.
And I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like,
Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah? (Laughter)
I already have in mind what I'm going to make,
and they're holding onto memory? Yeah?
So yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice. (Applause)
obviously dancers and other choreographers,
at least misbehave more beautifully, more often.
choreographic thinking, kinesthetic intelligence, to arm
provocations, I say, "If this happens, then that.
it's a space that my body can go inside of.
I can watch that and that can tell me something
Avoid it. Avoid it. Whoom. Kick it out of the way.
blah blah blah blah. The next solo, blah blah blah blah,
And we're going to build something now, organize it,
Going to watch it from the side, whoa.
reach out — you don't have to literally do it, but in mind —
Yeah? It's absolutely there.
Okay, brilliant. Okay, here we go. From the beginning,
scale that "E" so it's absolutely massive,
I'm not sure if this is going to be good or not.
people really who come from very different domains of
Great. Okay, from there, you're both getting up.
So they're solving this problem for me,
Whoa, underneath, whoo-um. Yeah? Underneath. Jump.
Okay. So that was -- (Applause)
we're both getting up, going in this direction,
You can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?
accessing this and what they're doing,
very simply. I can describe it in my arms, right?
That was the second way of working.
but also, more and more, with economists,
to the body? If I then said to you, what happens if
So, we all understand what it feels like to know
what you're going to do is go away and make a dance
Paolo, go. (Clicks metronome) Last you solo.
a point of departure to misbehave beautifully.
so one of the aspects of physical thinking
the sense of my own body in the space in the real world.
I can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa.
and I'm just going to teach it to them,
And we'll see what we come up with.
The first one, body-to-body transfer, yeah,
that they hold memory with for me.
So the dancers have been working on them.
So, you're going to do the first solo that we made,
Here we go. Catarina, big moment, here we go, one.
Yeah, you all have a body, right?
I'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it,
That's not the methodology at all that we work with.
Yeah, they're super quick, right?
That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere.
What I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it.
into somebody else's body,
So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it
of communicating ideas through the body to audiences
So this is a mental picture, I'm describing a mental,
aspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory
Yeah. Cat, can you put leg over that side? Yeah.
The second one, which is using them as objects to think
instead of it just being a letter that's in front of me,
so what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement
for yourself, and if not that,
and that's what's fueled me, then, to become a choreographer.
yeah? One way of making.
so I'm scaling that "E" so it's absolutely massive,
it's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something
explore this idea of physical thinking,
to work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah?
They're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going
mental dance, a little, in this little one minute,
So here goes, world premiere dance. Yeah? Here we go.
If you reach with your elbow, where would it be?
all of the decisions for themselves.
and it happens to be my body, and translate that
So yeah, let's clap -- yeah, let's clap afterwards.
You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup,
TED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly.
What I thought I'd do is, I'd make a TED premiere.
is I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something,
therefore solving a problem. They're enacting it.
this space that's really high and above. If I asked you to
and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me
can we do our phrases first? And then that.
We only think about them when they go wrong, so, when
on a different kind of creative process.
I think the technicities of creativity can be taught
a few physical extensions from the body as I move, and
We just don't think about our bodies very much.
What I'd like you to do is transplant that outside
They have something and they're going to hold on to it,
Fancy having eight hours with me in a day.
the phrases. Here we go. Nice and slow?
Three versions of physical thinking. I'm hoping that today,
They have no idea what we're going to do.
Usually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought
and they're generating it into a phrase.
Okay, you can open your eyes if you had them closed.
They start with small little units and build it up.
I know, I think we should keep them as a surprise.
how they're using it, and how they're thinking with it.
grasping information, how they're taking information,
and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it,
yeah, and both at the same time, you do the last solutions.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
there's a broken arm, or when you have a heart attack,
with it, and I can start to describe it, so I can describe it
when you hold out your arms, yeah?
If you reach with your finger, where would it be?
So what they're doing, let's see, something like that,
Grab her waist, come up back into her first, whoom, spin,
your own cognitive habits, and use that as
So I have to get myself in the zone. Right.
Yeah. Just a little bit more, here we go, from that place.
Okay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah?
I thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions
Well done. (Applause)
Nice, good job. Yeah? Okay. (Applause)
the real world. So I absolutely see a letter "T" in front of me.
reach out to the top of the "E," where would you reach?
So this is not the type of choreography where
that I'm going to just take the letter "T" and I'm going
that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception,
that whole wall on the side of "E" collapses and you have to
what would you be able to do with it?
but it's very, very quick, and this is a third method.
about dance. I'm passionate about making it,
so it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy.
expertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear
So they've been working on those mental architectures in the here.
Thank you. (Applause)
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
in those days: "Grease," "Saturday Night Fever,"
So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so
If, then; if, then. Okay, so here we go.
and the letter "D," to make something. Okay. Here goes.
I'm not asking them to copy exactly.
So what I'm thinking about is taking
of physical thinking to make something.
So all I'm doing is exploring this space of "T"
Whoom, just go back to the beginning.
going underneath. Whoa, whoa, underneath.
and I'm also really passionate about creativity.
Well done. Okay, good. Super. So --
So we're experts in physical thinking already.
let's infuse it with the color red, what does that do
and then I'm going to give it dimensionality.
I'm going to start really, really simply.
I've got something physical, yeah? And I can start to build something.
(Applause) Three versions of physical thinking, yeah?
to start dancing. My parents were very up for me going.
As you might imagine, I'm absolutely passionate
yeah? Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together,
to try, to try. I had an opportunity, an access
Okay, not bad. (Applause) A little bit more?
But how is it that we can start to think about using
to generate the beginnings of a phrase.
Ready and go ... um. (Clicks metronome)
You know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way.
into something that's physical.
of this binary information,
In fact, so great is the potential for cyber offense
doing the wrong thing.
So when you start to look at cyber from this perspective,
But that's not enough to blow up a battery.
inside of that contact list.
quite what I was looking for.
all with the press of a button
keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer
that sifting through ones and zeros
So I was frustrated, I was exhausted.
lower case letters followed by lower case letters
I've located the code
So what if we could unlock that potential
was surprisingly low on their priority list.
So let's go back to that
in a visual abstraction.
this is what the code on your cell phone looks like.
when I first started doing cyber, I wasn't sure
So I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery,
but wasn't having a whole lot of luck,
All I have to do is wait for the image to light up
How could I make such a stupid mistake?
with what I was trying to accomplish.
from one domain to something completely different?
This is what an image looks like
Now, as exciting as that sounds,
In fact, in terms of national security,
But that's where I step in.
and it's all just mixed together.
In this case, I was looking for a very advanced,
Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives,
but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead,
maybe no more terrorist,
all sorts of these different signals
but once in a while, part of my job is to break one of these things,
to see when I'm at similar pieces.
with a whole bunch of binary information,
into a physical representation,
but here's its visual abstraction.
So at this point, based on visual patterns,
On the one hand, it means we have whole new front
Now that I know it's a photograph,
is a tiny piece that controls your battery,
So let's step back from this theoretical situation
And the very first thing I want to do,
I bet I can find one of those things.
I'm really pretty good at this.
It's really, really hard to do at a binary level,
as a defense contractor,
This is what your music looks like,
that controls your phone,
that are similar to each other.
and waste a tremendous amount of time
that had nothing at all to do
We can go through every little detail
was a little bit off.
because whether he knew it or not,
In fact, I'm not really sure what this is,
It's not necessarily a bad thing.
This is what the code on your phone looks like,
My answer was vision.
All of this can be done in a matter of hours,
it shows us all the same information
Those are important things,
So at this point in the process,
Most importantly for me,
All of these things are made possible
from 1,000 miles away,
so even if I can't find the code for the battery,
I follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs
But after 30 minutes of work
and behind all of this is the software, the code,
You have code that controls your screen,
They control our nation's entire infrastructure.
I don't care what it does, how it works.
to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean.
when I first encounter something like this?
If we take those same concepts and translate them
everything it is that computers do.
but there's a lot of things that are very similar to that.
So this piece is caused by
spending your life sifting through binary information
is so much bigger than any one of those things.
of making a terrorist's phone explode,
What do our brains do perfectly naturally
So the next step in my binary analysis process
to visualize and understand that information,
I'm going to come in on a weekend,
because cyber isn't just about defense,
really, really hard,
It's easy to not see the forest through the trees.
for the code I was looking for.
It's really hard to analyze this at this level,
Unfortunately for me, I didn't know
but this is what clip art looks like.
For cyber, it means we have a radical new way
was not at all related to what I was looking for.
that we could exploit?

and I'm always looking for one key piece
I spent 30 hours piecing together
and used correctly, it can make your phone explode.
we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys.
but all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros,
to nuclear defense networks.
and maybe, maybe on my most glorious day,
keeping them working,
We have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information.
sequential chunks of binary information,
when looking at ones and zeros.
I wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten
but I wasn't going to give up.
You've got the pictures you've taken.
One of those most remarkable parts about all of this
thinking I was looking at the right thing,
A well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone,
in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation.
from a visual abstraction perspective.
The next thing I need to find is the code
So this is what Russian looks like
and get someone on the other line.
as opposed to weeks, months, at this level.
I started to get a better picture of what was there,
it was keeping someone's credit card information from being stolen.
This is what your contacts list would look like
the wrong path at this point,
every idea I'd ever encountered,
It would take me weeks just to figure out
and that's what I'm really after,
so that we can understand this information.
This is a lot of ones and zeros.
and look at something that actually happened to me.
which means my job is to sit down with this information
I'm a cybersecurity researcher,
This is what English text looks like
to something our brains do very naturally.
heat, clean water, food.
and try to make sense of it,
and yet again, I was trying to find
to translate a very hard problem
After 30 hours in the lab,
So I spent some time trying to put this together,
my job always starts with sitting down
it's also about offense.
For this, I need to identify
but this is what the code on your computer looks like.
We can instantly see all of the patterns here.
So I was playing around with these same concepts
But if we translate that information
another very hard thing to do
what we find is that we're capable of processing
So I looked at it at this level,
I'm going to get through this,
So I poured through every book I could find,
All I want to know is, what is this?
but when I stepped back a level
now have the ability to become first responders
about the ones and zeros I have on the screen here.
because computers are an integral part of all of our lives,
So that's what I did. I came in on a Saturday morning,
everything from missile silos to satellites
to process this stuff.
So he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes.
and throw more and more information at it,
it was that darn kitten again.
I sprinted out of my basement lab at work

It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code
But instead of just going home
So I know what English looks like at a binary level,
if I were examining it.
and I look at the relationships between those chunks.
all the important pieces, for us.
these binary patterns to visual signals,
to the right kind of information?
but that's still not enough to blow up a phone.
Well I thought, when you're looking at information at this level,
So after a while, I thought I had found the piece
We're entering an age where we talk about
and about 10 hours in, I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle.
is understanding how that code
is it gives us an entirely new way to understand

Computers control our military equipment,
and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation.

but years of experience in cyber
We're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros.
but it just blends in with everything else.
is to look at pieces of information
In seconds, we can pick out every pattern here.
cyber can make all of these things impossible.
because everything pretty much looks alike.
Unfortunately for me, we're not just talking
we could really unlock the power of our brains
They're the reason you have electricity,
very subtle, very detailed relationships
a way that we can immediately comprehend.
we should have been making the problem
as a remote detonator.
And the reason for that is cyber
We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts.
from looking at raw ones and zeros.

So what does this mean?
blow up the terrorist's phone situation.
this is what we get.
I can't even be looking at code.
Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem,
This is what English text looks like
For me, it means no more wasted weekends.

This is what I'm after in the end,
it was keeping people's Myspace pages from being hacked,

And the way I can figure that out
we can unconsciously apply those

responsible for controlling your battery,
and I asked myself, what do I do
By 20 hours, the pieces started to come together
inside of a massive piece of binary information.
It all comes back to those ones and zeros.
It's how they store information.
it's not just an image, this is a photograph.
but this is its visual abstraction.
but because our brains can instantly pick up
Well, for kittens, it means
In fact, from this perspective,
and I know what its visual abstraction looks like,
But this is what it looks like
Now, it used to be the only way we had
This is all well and good
it means that cyber engineers

but that's not necessarily true anymore.

I wanted to find out if this would really work
just by translating this

They're the reason you can call 911
The last piece of the puzzle
we can see the cross associated with code.
starts to seem kind of exciting.
I begin to get an idea of exactly
We've only begun to unlock the capabilities
I saw, this doesn't have similarities
he stepped into the realm of cyber.
So I started looking at the binary information,
more than anyone could possibly comprehend.
I figured out exactly what I was looking at,
That code looks pretty much like all the other code
in some sort of visual abstraction,
Binary information makes your phone work,
I soon found out that my idea of cyber

and asked myself, what went wrong here?
I do this for a living.
Because I know what one language looks like,
So if we could find a way to translate

He's going to use a cell phone
but that's not how I wanted to spend my life.
I didn't know quite what it would look like,
This is caused by spaces. This is caused by carriage returns.
A big part of my job is defending all of these things,
was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer,
is basically look at various pieces
When I have to do that, what I have to do
We're talking about billions and billions
I don't even have to sift through the raw data.
it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing.
and finally I decided,
because our brains have a tremendous potential
because in my mind, cyber
It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here,
The main difference is, at work,
This is how computers think, ones and zeros.
I could tell, this isn't code.
This is an image of some sort.
And from here, I can see,
that was in the ones and zeros,
It takes minutes for anybody to learn
drastically overload the circuit,
This is upper case by upper case,
We're entering an age where we can stop him
to analyze patterns.
So with these ideas in mind,
and I was right, it wasn't what I was looking for.
No more phone, no more detonator,
like any code that exists out there.
which looked pretty much the same.
very slowly — (Laughter) —
But I had this epiphany.
It's not how people think,
Computers control everything in your car,

But here's the catch: This is hard,

and I'm not going to leave
I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant.
I couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented.
It means we have a new weapon

It seemed to be about right, but I couldn't quite tell.

Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.
So why do we learn mathematics?
Suppose you wanted to look at
In fact, there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers,
On the other hand, because it's a rectangle,
two squared is four, three squared is nine,
So the area is also eight times 13.
Just as we created it.
beneath that, a five-by-five square,
21 by 34, and so on.
Let's look at the squares
And four plus nine is 13,
and when our students ask,
Now, I show all this to you because,

Let me show you one of my favorites.

Fibonacci numbers appear in nature

40 is five times eight,
Why should the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight
two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?
we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,
plus five squared plus eight squared. Right?
Fibonacci! Of course.
but if you look at them closely,

simply because it was fun or beautiful
which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?
and we study it to learn how to think logically,
But wouldn't it be great
the methods of arithmetic that we use today.
From the standpoint of calculation,
Now look at those numbers.
of the first few Fibonacci numbers.
that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,
like so much of mathematics,
what is the area of the rectangle?
Suppose you like to square numbers,
If you divide 13 by eight,
so let me give you a quick example
Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,
is typically a Fibonacci number,
five squared is 25, and so on.
or because it excited the mind?
the area is equal to its height times its base,
and that's why the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight
is not effectively motivated,
Now these numbers can be appreciated
We'll start with a one-by-one square
and next to that, a three-by-three square,
Since we've correctly calculated the area
Well, on the one hand,
Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,
Now, I know many people have not
and yes, the pattern continues.
Mathematics is not just solving for x,
Now, if we continue this process,
they're as easy to understand
the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)
Those are not Fibonacci numbers,
But you wouldn't expect anything special
and the height is clearly eight,
and the base is five plus eight,
and one plus four gives us five.
a number which has fascinated mathematicians,
It's one squared plus one squared

Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci
Now let me ask you a simple question:

it would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel,
and making a lot of mistakes,
because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested,
in this image, the waste water treatment plant
and en route I discovered that what's really required
But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you
using it in the marine environment, we'll be using it,
and that's without doing anything about efficiency.
and they use CO2, which is good,
We call it OMEGA, which is an acronym for

Now, why do we want to do this offshore?
There's lots of possibilities.

harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae
and put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the system
Those small organisms have been around
They of course use solar energy to grow,
other bi-algal products of interest.
and what I mean by economics is,
and this would be a market driver as we build the system
seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you
I think we need to consider everything,
some of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet,
as sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lots
in the marine environment, and we set up a field site
right now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.
if there was a possibility to develop biofuels
is controlled by the surrounding water temperature.
The algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned,
We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it,
but also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.
The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.
These were the structures that would be floating at the

So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could
So the column actually had another very nice feature,
than you have to put into the system
we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.
and some form of microalgae that produces oil,
So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact
Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.
Well, we found of course that this material became
in NASA where they would like to spin it out into something
And what about operating costs?
It was a place where we were growing algae
warming the soil to increase the growing season,
or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco,
which is also going to be an issue in the future,
which circulated some of the water,
The larger column that we then installed in San Francisco
for anybody and everybody who's interested
This is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 miles
well-known plastic that we have good experience with, and
The waste water that leaks out is water that already now
Now really what we were doing,
Some years ago, I set out to try to understand
for this system, we'd need 325 million gallons

to be able to make the system run?
CA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.
at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab
and of course you'd have to make a large area of this,
going to need to use in our marine environment?
We did engineering to understand what we would need
of this system in the marine environment,
Our research covered the biology of the system,
and we make it out of some kind of flexible material
on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.
and are going to be many.
Where else could we potentially put this system?
Where are we going to put this,
in our collective and connected ingenuity.

what is the energy required to run the system?
So there's always a big question that comes up,
The other thing to consider is the structure itself.

sequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels
I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish
I set out to find a pathway
Sustainable solutions for our future problems
So different cities around the world treat their waste water
We put waste water and some source of CO2
we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.
at the California Fish and Game facility,
and we're being radically open with this technology
and they produce oxygen as they grow.
and because they're living in waste water,
Do you get more energy out of the system
And finally, we wanted to see where we could look at
for sustainability is integration more than innovation.
and we circulate it through this floating structure,
for recovering the waste water.
and we know the importance of potentially getting
a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how
you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.
of sewer pipes under the city already,
Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water,
and if you start thinking in terms of
on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels
or train him to be able to clean the surface
and a source of flue gas for the CO2,
that'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lots
And what you see here is the prototype,

live in salt water, so they die.
It's modular. Let's say something happens that's
that moves with waves underwater,
they're fresh water algae, which means they can't
to test some of these ideas.
so you can see some things like soybean,
Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because
which makes 50 gallons per acre per year,

and if you look at where most of the waste water

and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses
and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.
to be able to do to build this structure,
so that we could monitor the way they grow,
will use solar energy to grow the algae,
Now, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools
of these things, but that's for the future.
and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks
it allows us to control weeds,
and the system that we're going to build, of course,
Why are we talking about microalgae?

everything from alpha to OMEGA.
JT: Thank you. (Applause)
to the surface and can skim it off with a net.
Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it
and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow,
but in California, there's a huge amount of plastic
compared to a human hair.
And what about capital costs?
So here's what I came up with.
because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation
Long term, I have great faith
and it releases its waste water offshore.
if we find ourselves in a protected bay
are going to be diverse
of different species of microalgae in the world,
and you can harvest them and make biofuels
And what about, just, the whole economic structure?
Can this project continue to move forward within
or wave energy or even wind energy,
for millions of years and there's thousands
Well, I don't know if you know about this,
San Francisco produces 65 million gallons a day
Jonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage now
Some cities just release the water.
into our floating structure,
for mixing the algae, and the temperature
but not compete with agriculture for water,
and 5,000 gallons per acre per year,
So what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro --
where we're growing mussels or scallops.
and the wave energy on the surface provides energy
totally unexpected to one of the modules.
The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2,
we need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water,
of designs, most of which were horrible failures,
They suffocate because they produce oxygen, and they
to take it on and try to make it real.
So we would remove the algaes that concentrated
green energy fund to come and take it by the throat?
and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and
to see what impact this would have on marine organisms.
before we recirculated the water.
of integrated activities.
That is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000
and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off
an alternative liquid fuel.
So what I'm telling you about is a system
overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop
just underwater, and we fill it with wastewater
We'd be growing oysters and things
so it increases biodiversity.
It would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year,
So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy,
with doing it in the United States because of limited
and this surface, which is covered by seaweeds
of the system, and finally we looked at the economics,
of these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.
and would periodically work its way across this little
There's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.
I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals
the artist's conception of how this system might look
San Diego Bay is another example,
and when we finally got to a design that worked,
surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material
It provides a surface for things in the ocean,
Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.
Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy
Here you see a graph showing you the different types
if we are radically open
So the most important feature that we needed to develop were these
a picture of those single-celled organisms
finding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.
like fishermen and ships and such things, but hey,
to 450 gallons in San Francisco.
which was the first attempt at building this type of column.
and that is the algae settle in the column,
in Moss Landing Marine Lab.
Well, that's less than one percent
right along the surface of the soil, and this provides
and we're working on methods now
so you'd have to worry about other stakeholders
So how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.
this system that I'm showing you, and that is to say
So let's envision what the system might look like.
floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy
we were working in four areas.
And the system is contained. What do I mean by that?
that allowed us to get into the lives of algae
so-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.
At NASA, you have to have good acronyms.
somewhere in the world, and we have in the background
you could also include in such a facility aquaculture.
So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about
what the impact of this structure would be
and welding plastic and building tools
But in all cases, the water that's released is
don't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produce

CA: All right. Thank you so much.
and produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.
So let me show you how the system works.

We also set up experiments in San Francisco

in which we're going to launch it out there
to accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acres

is integrated with aquaculture.
we can think in terms of how it might contribute
So you're probably thinking, "Gee, this sounds
and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass
which is about 20 percent of the biodiesel,
what makes them happy, how do we make sure that
integrating all of these different activities,
It really requires, at this point, people on the outside,
remove the oxygen, which we did by building this column
which included studying the way algae grew,
Well, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz

So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture

So, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing,
So, what's going on today
So, whenever you lost information, you'd move to symmetry;
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects,

So, what I thought I would bring up is
In a housing project in Valencia, Spain, we're doing,

So, for roughly 300 years,

so it's all one continuous change

in the SETI program. And that's the way I work.
So, for instance, I might put some limbs on the character here.
I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects
People call me a game designer, but I really think of these things more as toys.
to look at alternate possibilities in evolution.
the player's imagination-amplifier?
Now at this point we're leaving the water,
So here we are, at a very microscopic scale,
So basically, what we're getting here is
could I build a toy where kids would kind of trip across
I really actually think of them more as toys.
So here's a little city with some of our guys kind of walking around in it.
So the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database
It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life.
And I started putting those two together and wondering,
anything they can think of in this editor, and we'll basically bring it to life.
how much plants are required for the herbivores to live,
were all designed by the player up to this point.
"The Day the Earth Stood Still," "2001: A Space Odyssey,"
I think it's an entirely different kind of point of view, where we're actually mapping,
and right off the bat you basically just have to live, survive, reproduce.
You know, this is almost like designing something like Maya
to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles.
The idea is that the player can basically design
We didn't want to replay actual evolution
Basically, I want to be able to play,
Now one of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO is a monolith
these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play.
in just a few minutes,
but at some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will entirely evaporate.
that they didn't really think was possible before.
And so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing, with the disk slowly rotating,
Things like the buildings, and the vehicles, the architecture, civilizations
So at this point, we've left the water, and now with this little creature --
Here it is, some indigenous life down here.
but when you can give them a toy, and they can experience these long-term dynamics
So not only will it get hotter,
And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago
So most people have no idea of the difference between like,
and they really cared about what would happen to it.
Now, we actually play through many generations here, at the cellular scale.
So in fact, as I'm interacting in this world with other creatures,
And so that's why I think, personally, that toys can change the world.
And you actually start this game in a drop of water,
into the atmosphere, and so that's what I'm doing here.
because you have about roughly one supernova every century or so.
I can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel, so you sculpt it
but then later, I realized that that was the high point of my education.
I think I'll leave before they get hostile.
for games -- it really stuck with them
kind of larger and larger organisms.
and then redistributed to all the other players transparently.
I'm just going to pop in at the start of the game.
and this is something a texture artist would take many, many days to work on.
which you can also do in the game, or just curious,
physics, chemistry, sociology, economics, astronomy.
an amplifier for the player's imagination,
And so, the games that I do, I think of really more as modern Montessori toys.
and get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in.
at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales.
And at the time I didn't think much about it,
This world was actually extracted from the player's imagination.
it's automatically sent up to a server
and compress them into very short-term kind of experiences.
I think probably is the most effective thing I can be doing
from very, very small to very, very large.
And so we're procedurally generating the texture map,
You might be a networking god, building alliances,
So in some sense we want this to feel like
So one of the things I can do is start pumping more CO2 gases
and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find, maybe like in the Hubble,
one of these creatures wants to mate with me. Yeah.
what could they discover? What might they learn on this?
So as we eat, the camera starts pulling out, and then we start interacting with
It occurs at all these different scales, first of all,
It kind of knows how stripes should run, how it should be shaded.
I can also play with the dynamics of this world over time.
and start animating it, it's actually kind of amazing,
the next generation of our creature. So it has a little spine.
And not only that, but also show the dynamics,
We can mate, so I'm going to see if
and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it,
of empathy in connection to it. Even if it wasn't as
Eventually they would go out into space, and start colonizing and exploring the universe.
and getting some sense of what we're doing now, what it's going to be like in 100 years,
where the spine, the limbs are.
And I started looking at how interesting Drake's Equation was,
but they're always static. And when you actually bring it forward in time
But basically, this is the editor where we're going to design
You know, what happens if you give somebody a toy planet,
When they were able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount
I'm going to skip way ahead here to the space phase.
very long-term dynamics over the short term,
This game's called "Spore." I've been working on it for several years.
the topology of this creature. It kind of knows where the backbone is,
And since they discovered those things, it really stuck with them so much more,
In fact, I can look over here, and this is kind of a little simplified food web
Almost, again, like the Montessori toy idea.
is that players love making stuff.
you can kind of explore here. Now, as we move into the future,
but also geologic, you know, on a very simple core scale.
and letting them replay dynamics,
of life and nature through play.
make something very cool. And it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side.
Now what I really wanted to do is to present this,
is we're running around and surviving, and also getting to the next generation,
I'd start dealing with tribes, cities and civilizations of them over time.
So in fact, we're going to have this unlimited number of worlds
and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution.
And I think by giving kids toys like this
would actually come to understand these deep principles
Now, at this point we're actually dealing with a very little toy planet.
and walk up, and they should be worshipping me at this point as a god.
Let's fly to another one.
So at any rate, then I bring this back into the game. It's born,
OK, so that's the complete model. Now we can actually go to the painting phase.
So basically, I want the players to be able to experiment and explore
very simple geology. For instance, I could open one of my tools here and then
high-leverage tools, so that for a very small amount of effort the player can
so I figure it's OK amongst this group.
And now, because I'm actually the one here, I can, if I want to, get out of the UFO
and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.
We have very simple little weather systems you see here,
If we pull all the way back, we start seeing the entire galaxy here,
You see, now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics.
But I'm going to skip way ahead here. Now, normally what would happen
and as you play the game the creature is actually growing bit by bit.
Because if you think about it, you're going to have 15-year-olds,
But we also have stars and things as well.
rather than being taught these things overtly.
to have extracted an entire world that they're now interacting with.
and so static. As we pull away from the star here, we're actually going

OK, we got him. Now we get a meal.
Now, in the evolution game here, the creature scale, basically you have to eat,
So here's our little solar system, as we pull away from our melted planet here.
the Anthropic Principle, the origin of life.
You can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities,
So I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient.
and that's a fundamental aspect of this.
Now here, our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface,
The players are going to play through every generation of this species,
So it's acting with its two mouths there.
like the Copernican Principle, the Fermi Paradox,
so that other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery as I did
and you can kind of experiment with this planet again as a toy.
just a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking.
Things where you might trip across things
but really it represents this huge set of possibilities.
One of the things that always frustrated me a little bit about astronomy
At at any rate. I would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky
there's an editor for in the game that the player can create,
and that actually brings up an interesting point about games.
as it exists and as it might go in the future.
across these vast scales of space and time.
Now also with this phase, we're getting more and more God-like powers for the player,
But I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods,
and one thing that's kind of important about this game is that, at every level,
swimming around. And I actually realize that cells don't have eyes,
that I would choose to make, it's that I would like to somehow give people
and if you'll start noticing, we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time.
that you actually have to balance actively.
And most games kind of put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker,
Now as we pull away from this world -- we're going to keep pulling away from the star now.
We might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe, and try and eat him.
Now as you can see, these guys are actually starting to go up
of content. And pretty much everything you're going to see in this game,
And I can see how it might dance.
But really the goal here was, within about a minute, I wanted somebody to replicate
we're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here
how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat, etc.,
"Star Trek," "War Of the Worlds."
and this is a little bit closer to the 240 dollar man or so, but --
using the game to re-map our intuition.
I think if there's one difference I could possibly make in the world,
that an eight-year-old can use.
So as I start pumping in more atmosphere,
part of this is about bringing the beauty of this, of the natural world,
So a few years ago, I actually started getting very interested

One of my favorite shows as a kid was "The Six Million Dollar Man,"
So that's kind of what these tools are about, are: how do we make the game play
to a macro-evolution scale.
So at first they'll go up, and then they'll evaporate, and that'll be my planet.
and this is roughly what it would look like. And so really,
But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here.

And then you would ask: How happy are the moments
so we need to have that debate fairly soon.
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,

This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,
and getting confused between them is part of the mess

For the remembering self, a two-week vacation
it's a completely different thing.
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen
Now, the experiencing self

and much less than before.
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.
and in other countries it is happening.
and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"
you get a different story.
There is a lot of happiness coaching.
then the one that chooses

Imagine that for your next vacation,

but in the U.K., it is happening,

that they should count,
you may end up -- some people may end up
They counted for nothing
and, in this case, the ending dominated.
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,
no question about that,
because we apply it to too many different things.
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.
And it turns out that, below an income
is twice as good as the one-week vacation.
And yet, somehow you get the sense
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
Endings are very, very important
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,
That will cause the patient

by the remembering self.
But now, because the reflective self is in charge,
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,
He had had the experience.
And the one that is worse
because, if you have a patient who has had, say,
it starts immediately.
And then there is a remembering self,
Most of them are completely ignored
and if you think in terms of memories,
relative to the weight that we put on experiences?
In the United States, efforts are being made
We know that happiness is mainly
It turns out that the word "happiness"
you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,
but lack of money certainly buys you misery,
and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.
and the second week is just as good as the first,
and I hope I have given you a sense
and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance
which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,
goals are very important.
And basically you can look at this,
about how happily they're living their life,
It is actually the one that makes decisions
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --
if you have a vacation,
to think straight about well-being,
"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"
most of them don't leave a trace.
and it's not even very important to the reflective self
Why do we put so much weight on memory
you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A
We know that money is very important,
and that really doesn't teach you much
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"
than remember and tell stories.
What are the emotions that can be measured?
if you think in terms of time,
and it's also true of the stories that we make up.
is that we do not attend to the same things
and it has been done, and it does work --
satisfaction of the happiness self.
would take a finding like that seriously
I had somebody count the number of books
those are their recordings.
We found that with respect to the happiness
is a fairly complicated process.
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --
that memory delivers for us,
and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.
Now, the remembering self
is in the handling of time.
And they're all -- happiness for moments
but even if you do more of this,
goes very different ways depending on how you think,
another reason we cannot think straight about happiness
And those are two very different concepts,
we don't think of our future normally as experiences.
The biggest difference between them
and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,
How to enhance happiness
or happy with your life.
Now, what you could do with Patient A,
and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.
and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,
and they're really quite distinct.
there is a conflict between your two selves,
between California and other places,
and at the very end of the recording,
and being happy about your life
clearly, B had a worse time.
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.
And the main lesson I think that we have learned
and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.
is going to mess up the study of happiness,
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.
and the experiencing self,
and I calculated, you know, the psychological present
you are thinking of the contrast
about his experience.
It is a completely different notion.
I mean, how much do we consume our memories?
I mean, it seems to turn upside down
we choose between memories of experiences.
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.
that distinguishes a remembering self
since you do have a few moments left now?
So we have the remembering self
I mean, most of the moments of our life --
as a substitute for well-being.
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.
60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,
Is that something you can share
the experiencing self and the remembering self,
that the remembering self keeps for us.
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?
But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,
There is an experiencing self,
They are lost forever.

If people took seriously that finding,

And the answer is really straightforward:

this is very frequently the case;
That does not hold for emotions.
so it's a large representative sample --
It's the finite resource that we're spending

The Gallup Organization has a world poll

That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.

the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic,

and sticking it with stuff.
I don't mean looking at it from that way -- abusing the little species.
but there's a place called "Cancer Alley,"
and, once again, kills people.
And what we don't often appreciate
that's giving people cancer in places like "Cancer Alley" and shortening lives
And so we're on one planet,
There's no poison. There's no pollution.
And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize

There's a constant tough decision

how much of our fisheries would we be covering?

There's something like 80 coastal countries.

And this is a big problem. It's continuing.
It's more than a thing we're doing
But how many of these countries do we have to work in?
the fisheries, which are always crashing, it seems,
unless we have traceability.
We know because we've seen it happening
But we know how to turn it around,
Well, based on our work in the United States
If we do those three things, we know the fisheries will come back.
Do we have to fix fisheries management

And this is a big concern,
We can restore a lot of our fisheries

and they get thrown overboard wastefully.
The way illegal fish get into our market is through seafood fraud.
So we didn't have peak fish yet.
It takes a little bit of fuel,
You might have heard about this.
First we want to know where the fish are,

It can reduce our risks of cancer,

Think about the last time you had fish.
Because we tested 1,300 different fish samples
we need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental
frustrating, tedious process.
When they set the discard limit,
and it's very wasteful;
when you fish in places where you're not supposed to fish,
up to 100 million metric tons per year.
And that's something the oceans have been doing

and I'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too
He's getting out of San Quentin in a couple of weeks" —
They get involved in different worlds than their worlds
with people unlike them,
and that is a huge shift in mindset,
and because they do that,
is to see it one where we all become
or a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect
and you trust each other.
That guy could teach it.
where they can bring the right team in
So what did they do?
That's why I'm sitting here.
And indeed they were.
I said, "I know someone you ought to meet.
than to become opportunity-makers
And as I started to look at people,
they can be used for dangerous ones.
that every new building in Los Angeles
should have public art in it.
because even more than giving,
Unlike an increasing number of Americans
and she fervently started —
He had workout regime he did every day.

who think exactly like them
because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.
I think she was following me at that point.
that's probably your greatest,
he was also teaching racquetball.
is the capacity for us to do something smarter
But here's the icing on the cake:
who is here from Chicago? —
and he watched them when they were practicing,
Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength
more often to accomplish greater things together
or politics or lifestyle.
I started thinking about it
and I think that's what we're looking at.
to unite together as opportunity-makers
For example, Marty is the husband of that actress I mentioned,
and trends that transcended business
you're in the wrong room.
who had what I called a mutuality mindset.
and I believe in doing that.
They met together. They prepared.
In each situation, they found a way to talk about us
and recruit them to solve a problem better and faster
no equipment provided.
We talk about ourselves.
What I'm asking you to consider
and create that "us" idea.
he was teaching the racquetball teachers.
and accomplish things we couldn't have done on our own.
What I'm suggesting is, when you connect with people
around sweet spots of shared interest.
And I want to talk to you about that,
and, like at least 20 other people
is what kind of opportunity- makers we might become,
It calls on us, each of us,
as so many of you already do —
in different worlds very different than mine,
key players who are uniquely positioned to do this,
and they'd pose and they'd vamp
and to reimagine a world
really wanted attention and recognition.
and he's a professor, and he loves place-making,
This world is calling out for us to have a collective mindset,

That's how Wally got hired.

And she had the fervent belief

these bean-shaped reflective sculptures

as Dave Liniger once said,
And here's a strange thing:
I know that firsthand —
So what I'm asking you is,
Not only that, years later
Thank you. (Applause)
in a room of this size,
They spoke in front of the Los Angeles City Council.
and they'd take selfies together,
so they're trusted and they can see those patterns,
And I'm not saying this is easy,
because when we are treated that way,
I truly believe, in my firsthand experience,
that if you're the smartest person in the room,
and I was in Europe and I was supposed to cover trends
and people would walk up to it
and where they're dotted with art,
So let me tell you about
and then, as we know from the news every day,
way back when I was a Wall Street Journal reporter
But I also want to point something else out:
It's not just the first opportunity
That's what opportunity-makers do.
things happening into the future,
and they communicate to connect
so they could see how these trends could affect their lives.
And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,
because we then become more rigid and extreme,
that art should engage and enable people to connect."
There's no greater opportunity
in a way stepping into the reader's shoes,
And yet there are other people I observed
but what I want to suggest is,
and we were soon talking about something
And the council members not only passed the regulation,
as an institution or an individual.
and they can be devised by more people
which is mostly all I did,
or call for action for us now
Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers.
greater opportunity-makers with and for others.
They could practice in their hotel room,
We open ourselves up to those opportunities,
this is an opportunity.
they're fascinated by them,
than we could on our own.
That disproves that popular notion
So I had to have contacts
my friend the ex-con,
and once you feel it, you want it to happen a lot more.
and seize more opportunities.
and he's rather easy on the eyes because he's buff.
who use best talents together more often
She wanted a regulation for it,
and he was soon talking to Wally,
and they become pattern seekers.
and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes
It's after you've had that experience
So here's what I'm calling for you to do.
that lifts us both up
"and he shares your fervent desire
They're not affronted by differences,
I have a set of racquetball courts.
And third, I had to write the story
opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations
And not just that. There's James. He's an architect
where people draw and come up and talk sometimes.
Remember, I was young then.
even more than giving,
He spent five years in solitary,
and in this room are key players in technology,
I said, "He'd be an unexpected ally."

It's the unexpected things

and they'd smile in the reflection of it,
They were startling, compelling and credible.
Because things can be devised like drones
she fervently started talking about
It's especially important now.
and I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin,
that we both felt passionately about: public art.
half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards.
the world is hungry for us
where we use our best talents together
So my idea to reimagine the world
diagnosed as phobically shy,
around each other's better side and bring it out.
together for the greater good
you never could have predicted.
the world is hungry.
Those are motions that are not visible to us
and pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras.
in the way her classmates move.
and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
Here is a side-by-side comparison.
and we can even do that when the camera
and we're going to turn that bag of chips into a microphone
You can see the baby's sleeping, but there's not too much information there.
We've only just begun exploring
This tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way,
and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany,
It's a video I recorded about three years ago.
We just provided this new tool, a new way to look at the world,
Even when a person is sitting still,
So we use some clever image processing techniques
but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras,
the tiny motions in that video.
We also know that singers can break a wine glass
And it turns out, there's a lot of phenomena
because sound can't travel in space, but light can.
So this is the sound that we were able to recover in that case.
What you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin,
we're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality
with this great group of people you see here,
but we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face.
but still, just from the video, we're able to extract his pulse
We can see that our eyes are constantly moving
we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope.
Maybe in the future, we'll be able to use it, for example,
I call it the visual microphone.
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
So here, we're going to play a note
changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes.
And you know, presumably he's wearing makeup,
So I too got one of those baby monitors
and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them.
And this is pretty much what you'll see with a standard baby monitor.
so we have to be very careful when you try to separate them
we can very clearly see how the glass vibrates
and then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing.
MR: We used "Mary Had a Little Lamb"
where you can upload your videos and process them online,
but that we've never been able to see with our own eyes until now.
So that's exactly what we did.
that they're breathing, that they're alive, of course.
and actually seeing those motions as they happen
and everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.
We make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos, or magnified videos,
We can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies.
So over the past few centuries, microscopes have revolutionized our world.
or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces.
But it might actually be useful for other things as well.
But it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color,
It's like seeing still pictures come to life.
Here's a demonstration of recording and replaying sound with Edison's phonograph.
Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
in this wobbly motion.
And it doesn't even have to be a video we recorded.
So as scientists, we started wondering,
but here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing
MR: And now, 137 years later,
So I just took a short clip from "Batman Begins" here
Maybe we could use those motions
There's not too much we can see.
by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects,
just by observing how light bounces off objects
It's very simple to use.
of what others have done with it.
if they hit the correct note.
the lighting here is kind of challenging,
and the heart rate measurement we get
Can we actually invert this process and recover sound from video
That's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out
It basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm
in the neck that are involved in producing the sound.
And just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here,
so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep.
but instead it uses a video camera and image processing
but also if the object moves.
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
about their breathing patterns, small facial expressions.
Again, if you stare at that video,
there's a lot of information we can extract
Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
and I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website,
and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions.
Wouldn't it be better, or more informative, or more useful,
but measuring those motions is one thing,
We can do it essentially with other videos as well.
so even if you don't have any experience in computer science or programming,
it also redefines what we can do
and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
But this made us think. It gave us this crazy idea.
We can actually see a human pulse.
So here are two examples.
Today I'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope,
Our skin, for example, changes its color very slightly
those changes that we're after, are extremely subtle,
to make small objects bigger,
to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions.
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
that was motion-magnified.
suddenly we see a completely different image.
Those are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways,
to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy.
Michael Rubinstein: And here's that speech again recovered
but once we look at this video through our new, special microscope,
Sound, as we all know, is basically changes
Everything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration
In this way, we can turn everyday objects into microphones.
but also tiny motions,
We make them bigger so that we can see them.
This is me demonstrating my great singing skills.
and measure our heart rates.
through a loudspeaker that's next to it.
Once we play that note and magnify the motions 250 times,
They are a tremendous contribution to science and technology.
And I took a high-speed video of my throat while I was humming.
which is why, when you look at other people,
at every pixel in the video over time,
So here's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table,
a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer.
we made our code available online so that others could use and experiment with it.
by filming it with a video camera
We basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded
but are visible to a camera with the right processing.
Testing, testing, one two three.
try it out yourself,
when you look at the person sitting next to you,
is that we had nothing to do with them.
And we can do that not just to visualize the pulse,
from noise that always exists in videos.
and then people find other interesting, new and creative ways of using it.
We can also magnify small mechanical movements,
And I'd like to show you just a couple of examples
in air pressure that travel through the air.
that's in the resonance frequency of that glass
what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions
But we didn't stop there.
and gets recorded by our cameras.
And ever since we discovered this new technology,
So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez85.
there's not too much we can see,
It lets us see physical processes that we know are there
There's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video
And it lets us look at our world in a completely new way.
And one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound.
and analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it.
from a video we took with a regular DSLR camera,
And you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs,
and everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.
and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth
You can also do some art with it.
It's not something you're used to seeing every day.
So what do I mean by color changes?
So here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby
We actually extract audio signals from video signals.
and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
The tricky part is that those signals,
and then the way the color changes over time,
That signal is there in that video.
but also to actually recover our heart rates,
and resonates in response to the sound.
a microscope for changes.
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
because those are said to be the first words
So here I took the motions and I magnified them 30 times,
I call it -- Thank you.
magnified 100 times so that they become visible.
It doesn't use optics like a regular microscope
We can recover sounds from other objects, like plants.
that was wrapped around the cylinder.
So again, in the source video, in the original video,
We can see how fast Steve's heart is beating,
there's not too much you'll be able to see,
is 15 feet away from the object, behind soundproof glass.
So how do we do all that?
that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil
And the nice thing with all those examples
but once we magnify the motions, the breathing becomes much more visible.
(Video) Voice: Testing, testing, one two three.
just from this video of that same bag of chips.
is as accurate as the one you'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital.
will change not only if the color of the object changes,
Those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them,
you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope.
that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes.
so you can see I wasn't getting too much sleep. (Laughter)
That change is incredibly subtle,
and that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras
She wanted to see if there's any difference
But it turns out that sound also produces visual motions.
but he, or she, used our code
just to show Christian Bale's pulse.
and show it quite well.
and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born,
but once we magnify the motions 100 times, we can see all the motions and ripples
to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people,
that Thomas Edison spoke into his phonograph in 1877.
if instead we could look at the view like this.
to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video,
And as new parents, we all want to make sure our babies are healthy,
which is how we hear and how we record sound.
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
And that's actually my eye,
and then we amplify those changes.
Our collaborators at Quanta Research even created this nice website
It can work on your own videos.
So here's a person speaking in a room.
When we look at this video of Steve here, it appears to us like a static picture,
when the blood flows under it.
So this is my daughter when she was about two months old.
So this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale.
that actually show us those changes.
you don't see their skin or their face changing color.
So here's the sound that we played in the room.
That's one thousandth of a millimeter.
and then we crank up those changes.
Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems,
People have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands.
that we could now use our cameras to measure?
And we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients.
She made them all stand still, and then magnified their motions.
I don't know who that user is,
It was one of the first sound recording devices in history.
But it's pit crews that we need,
but we don't think too much
that get forgotten or missed

that premiers next month, "Girls,"
I don't like to acknowledge a problem
but those shows only lasted a season each,
their writing, their photography, whatever,
people expect women to be that easy to understand,
I mean, the whole premise of the shows
and that feels accurate for all people,
girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to
because I think one thing that can be very alienating
being perfectly consistent in your beliefs,
that was not this kind of one-dimensional
and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.

So I think the question of what makes a strong female

"On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"
and it's seen as power.
and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling
And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,
I was ending middle school, starting high school --
was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,
and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings
she said she wanted to start it because she felt that
were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,
oops -- I'm figuring it out!
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.
and "We're perfect role models," because we're not,
who is maybe not immediately likable,
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about
So I was trying to figure all that out,
but you don't see women represented like that as much.
all of these differences that you're told you can't be
and she makes you listen to them and think about them,
and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.
We also have articles called

So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.
The problem with this is that then

We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.

that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.
How do we study that?
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.

It would be very dangerous if you fell down.

SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous?

SW: You are very special. What would you like to say
amongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited.
SW: There you go. And, of course, if all else fails,
because you're in love with a pirate?
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.
and travelling through space -- it's all very dangerous jobs.
So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.
Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping
SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.
Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk.
SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job
You were saying that you were really embarrassed,
Why do we want to protect your home?
Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee?
I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?

and she's pretty nervous to meet him.
so Einstein wanted to do something special for him.
SW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember?
Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her.
SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006,
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves
Einstein, can you also sing?
Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes
SW: Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.
And we didn't think he'd be in town then,
to help protect their homes that they live [in].
SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?
She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.
Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here,
she's very interested in things that fly.

SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein.
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.

SW: And how about those cats?

Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls?
all the exciting speakers here for the conference.
SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier,
Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part
SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.
SW: And what do you say when it's time to go?
on her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera?
Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance.
SW: Yeah, that's right. But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein.

The similar images actually have similar backgrounds,

So these images are entirely unlabeled, so I have to start from scratch.
These are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data

There are in fact quite a few errors.
So deep learning is this extraordinary thing.
this would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis, for example,

Now, if you want to do something that you don't know how to do yourself,
So I want us to start having this discussion now.
There's much work to be done in this area.
so now's the time to start thinking

In this case, it got kind of confused.
and I want to create something that can split them into the angle
Since that time, a lot has happened.
In 2012, Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm
Here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday.

Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook

So the human, as you can see here,
Deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works,
he had the computer play against itself thousands of times
So if you think, oh, it's all happened before,

So we need to be starting to think about this capability right now.
and the way they did it was that they fed street view images
another extraordinary result of deep learning
which is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world.
they've developed a machine learning-based system
So currently, we see the things around us
And indeed it worked, and in fact, by 1962,
and they get replaced by new jobs,
and we say, "Oh, computers are still pretty dumb." Right?
and the computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats
This is very different from actually understanding the images.

This is much like the way that humans learn.
I seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company,

and this algorithm is based on machine learning.
These are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do.

Sometimes, it's almost creepy.
okay, yes, you've done a good job of that.
the leaderboard actually showed it was better than people,
because human performance grows at this gradual rate,
So we do that for a while, we skip over a little bit,
I know that when I often tell people about this situation,

So he came up with an idea:
the standard text-to-speech system so that it would sound like me.
to be able to beat him at checkers.
and this is because it's using the power of machine learning.
So here we have to be a bit more careful,
For example, there will be more jobs for data scientists.
In 1956, he wanted to get this computer

but they generated new insightful science.
we've seen the results in the past of when new things come along
that I want to be able to take in this process
It's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything,
and you have no idea how it did it,
to do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques.
What we're doing here is we're replacing something that used to take a team
but with machine learning, this is now possible.
I was the president of Kaggle,
but it has independently generated this novel description of this picture.
What does that mean?
and it is now being used in industry.
which in fact is better than human pathologists
So here, the computer has successfully found areas,
Humans don't learn by being told what they see,
but as of last year, we're now beyond that too.
Not only could it recognize the traffic signs

We can then use this concept of similar images,
a group there announced that, looking at tissues under magnification,

So from this vantage point, I was able to find out
They used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning.
If you want to be able to tell the difference between, say,

We're still not quite at human performance here, but we're close.
How can you write a program,

And here is some text that an algorithm out of Stanford generated.
Well, computers can't really think,

I want to give you an example.

So by 2011, we had the first example

So machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this,
in making a diagnosis.
we are now up to an 80 percent success rate
which it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm.
and crunched the data on 16,000 computers for a month,
This is better than people, again.
Again, the result's not perfect.
And when it does so successfully,
but actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text.
The theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process
and as I'm typing in here sentences,

and it's been successful hundreds of times.
for example, angles.
that you do hear spontaneous applause,
and what it could do in the future.
Companies like Amazon and Netflix
So here we're starting with about 1.5 million car images,
the left sides and the right sides as much as possible
So this process takes about four or five iterations.
The thing is, though, that after a while, things flattened out.
and then we train the machine learning algorithm
and turn that into data analysis as much as possible,
trying to find new areas of structure.
For example, these four algorithms were all built by the same guy.
Deep learning now in fact is near human performance
So we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities.
it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images.

It's a big tokamak donut in Europe,

However, there has been a bit of politics going on,

And also, you have to catch the heat from those neutrons
with 17 megawatts of heat.
The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons
and therefore there's no damage to the machine.
that takes a little bit of time,
is by using laser fusion.
so you can pump that in a heat exchanger,
Now, it's very energy-dense,
so this injector makes the plasma to start with.
Now, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.

What about if we use a big hammer
That's the kind of machine that makes energy.
it produces solid, reliable power,
but we now can do that
about 10,000 times more than we started.
In the ocean, you can extract the fuel
So the physicists have been working on fusion for a while,
and then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,
and perhaps it will be General Fusion.
That cost way more than that.

We can't do that anymore.
They go like this. They go like that.
and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.
Now, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.
The liquid metal gets hot,
the politics got in and it delayed it a bit.
but it proved quite difficult to find something

the Joint European Torus.
When you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.
Now, fusion is often criticized
is in the future and will never happen,
and they say, it's not that it cannot be done,
So some people buy a Porsche.
and it cannot melt down.
Now, you say, that's not much use,
and it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity.
and you can see that we're making now
When you make fusion, the energy comes out
So I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that.
that they had managed to make more fusion energy
will produce 500 megawatts of fusion power
They are awesome pieces of technology,
Now, in MTF, what you want to do
so I think we have the plasma compressing now.
because it's a very, very good idea.
and one of the ways they do it
It makes lots of energy.
I think it's actually been shortchanged,
The particles go round and round and round
So we built this machine in this garage here.
So I thought about it for a minute,
And if you squeeze something hard enough,
So finally, most people think that fusion
in subsidies for oil and gas
about 10,000 times more fusion than we used to
So when I saw that, I said, well, this is such a shame,
This is nature's way of producing energy.
to make this progress.
a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year
So this is the inside of one of those donuts,
And then you have some pistons driven by pressure
Fusion is really, really hard to do.
to solve global warming and make fusion happen.
and also, they don't deal very much
Now, this dot here is called JET,
and this machine, when it's finished,
it tends to go a little bit crooked like that,
It's a big ring of magnetic coil,
and the will to do it was not there,
It would run for billions and billions of years.
So this one is the real one.
So this is the inside of one such machine.
The sun and all the stars in the universe
when I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia,
Now, the particle speed
So we are trying different types of energy now,
Now if you look at the graph, you will notice
comes from steam-powered pistons,
So back to the literature,
and it will make some energy,
except for the problem that it didn't quite work.
and it makes lots of energy,
So you take two small nuclei,
Now, I caught my little fusion bug
and I said, okay, how can we make that work better?
but as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.
but because it's a big international collaboration,
You see the laser beam and the pellet
he'll be very proud.
and this is how the nuclear reactor today works.
I don't think they're very good.
Now, that was not very satisfactory.
bang!, it compresses it,
I worked there for 10 years,
are pretty good machines.
We are almost there.
and put it on Facebook.
the fusion plasma in there.
So then I thought about impact.
to try to cook that to fusion temperature.
and pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.
So the whole planet needs a lot of energy,
So I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that.
Then when my dad sees that,
making printing for the printing industry.
Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there
and then it did absolutely nothing.
they are both positively charged,
And then there's fusion.
and they do that in one billionth of a second,
so it drifted to the right.
but then, bang! you hit the piston,
a little bit of neutrons out of that,
So the temperature required for fusion
in the south of France,
you have to throw them at each other with great speed,
and then I got a big job in a laser printer place
we could extract the fuel from the ocean.
as oil, gas and coal.
We made a small machine
and they're working hard, but nothing is happening.
The big labs have shown that fusion is doable,
It got us to where we are, but we have to stop.
It only produces short term radioactive waste,
This cell phone, and the Internet behind it,
than the energy that they put in the center of the ping pong ball.
which is way cheaper than lasers
Actually, the science to make those machines
And this is what we want to build.
going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine,
The lasers are very strong, and it squashes
they will go against the repulsion,
They had much more resources than me.
and no neutrons hit the wall,
and on those machines,
and burying you, all of you,
But you have to compare that to the cost
Now we know of two ways
However, as a power plant,
will crack that nut,
around the plasma, and it compresses it,
The second dot here is the NIF.
We also spend about 650 billion dollars a year
Now in fission, you take a big nucleus,
Others get a mistress.
So in order to make them fuse,
So the problem is, those two nuclei,
Now, a second way of doing this
Now, so the first thing I did
and some of the steam will go back
piston hits on the side,
So I decided I would need to find a solution
So it's going to be a big machine,
that we managed to squeeze
with only 50 megawatts to make it.
so they don't want to fuse.
So hopefully I can improve on that.
for about one thousandth of a cent
and this is why fusion is so hard to do.
as neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.
the circle at the wall.
However, plasma is difficult to compress.
must have cost a bit of energy too.
of making Moore's Law.
and now there are small companies that are thinking about that,
because the laser to put that energy in
produced 16 megawatts of fusion power
in millions of tons of junk mail.
Now in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball,
Well, there's always a bit of a catch.
Now, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.
Now magnetic and laser fusion
Now, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?
It's the National Ignition Facility.
and those are my marketing neutrons,
Okay, we also built this injector,
It works pretty good.
but it's actually pretty close,
with the fusion energy.
to open a vortex in the center,
pronounced in French: EE-tairh.
how does fusion work?
and if it gets really, really fast,
is this cell phone here in my pocket.
ITER, for example, could have been built
Well, flying you all in here
So this is a big collaboration of different countries
One way in particular attracted my attention,
We kind of have fallen off the progress.
and if they have enough speed,
The result of Moore's Law
which was not possible in 1970,
but it's how to make it cost-effectively.
They always think that the physicists are in their lab

The CDC recently conducted a survey

The most mentally sharp older adults

So if you ever feel like you don't have this aging thing quite pegged,
is the remarkable product of culture --
When time horizons are long and nebulous,
We invest in more emotionally important parts of life,
Originally the sample was aged 18 to 94.
Now it's really too simplistic
My father, who is 92,

On a one to seven scale, how happy are you right now?
we've found that these changes

And a recent Gallup poll

But that's not the case.
Because what that means
Aging brings some rather remarkable improvements --
when you're smiling at a friend.
Older people look toward the smiling faces
We might learn something unexpected.
we'd ask them to answer several questions --
Well in our research,
and younger people certainly.

more open to reconciliation.
and younger people as well.
where we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period.
these are the ones that should do it.
After all, aging is not a piece of cake.
you know, that tear in the eye

If we invest in science and technology

And every time we paged them
They're happier than middle-aged people,
we nearly doubled the length of time

we find that it's not one particular generation

We've said, well maybe older people

We're more appreciative,

Years ago, my colleagues and I embarked on a study

let me just zoom out for a minute.

But at no point does it return

That is that younger people today

Now to put this in perspective,
who can get chills from population statistics,
and we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times.
We've asked older and younger people
older people are happy.
why older people are better than younger people
it's that recognizing that we won't live forever
Sometimes I'm concerned
And fewer older people answered affirmatively to that question
And there is a slight downturn.
Maybe our neural centers in our brain
We might spend time with people we don't even like

How did this happen?
And using this intense study

And now, if you're the kind of person

But the more we've tried to disavow this finding,
But that same shift in perspective
It's hardly time to rest on our laurels.
Our participants would carry electronic pagers

And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.
So before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,
so she at least knows how to advise the patients better?
So that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.
in places where there's not enough electricity
and the next version we came up with was a box

So it means that you can actually embed
But it's not limited to just education.
The only thing that they don't have
to basically ascertain whether something like this actually

and all these kinds of very fundamental issues.
We are going through some reference tests to compare it

to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.
And that'll make such a huge difference on the system,
from getting access to health care.
and I'm going to tell you one more little story.
VV: So ... (Applause)
So that was a very simple three-step screening process

They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system

is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook
So, we kind of toyed around with this idea,
So what we did was that we converted this device

That's the real question, because this is something
BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.
We extended this idea. We tested it many times over,

You've got to try it on your own to believe it.
In India, there is a context of these amazing people,

and we said, "What can we do with this?
So we made this box, and we tested it again
that's deprived of enough resources.
Basically, you don't have to necessarily buy

So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.
Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.

But what fuels this?
and the lunch box is a nice little package
what this tinkering ecosystem is about,
The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,
So we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher
It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker
But what does this new, sort of, approach give us?
So I take it into the start position, and then
So we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?"
They are kids who scream at the top of their voices,
that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,

So one of the first things we did is this thing called

Basically, what he does is, he has all these services
It's an informal school,
but it's really about holistic education.
that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,
with basic tools and basic concepts of health care,
This kind of a technique or metrology
where they can fix almost anything.
Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.
So everything from a common cold
(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.
So we said, "What can we get out of this?
and the main purpose is basically to inform people
And we took it back to this little tinkering setup
We went and scavenged the nearby markets,
to dismantle, take things apart,
but he does it for people offline
But then we were wondering whether this is
is we are trying to scale this up, because there
give at least a fraction of them the access to these things,
And then, the most important thing is,
It's actually happening in all parts of the country.
The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,
Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.
we reassemble it in a new configuration,
make this box run off a USB key, because we realized
to give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)
Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange
It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,
There's the traditional crafts,
And we do this because we actually believe
BG: Great. Good news. (Applause)
so it means that you can do a lot more with it.
not just in one street corner in Mumbai.
And we systematically field tested,
But the problem with that is that we realized
a local phenomenon, or is truly global?
It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.
or the amber, it basically meant you had to have,
But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering
to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental
We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,
So essentially, the three things that are required

And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.
We desperately need great communication from our

the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.
What do bullets do? Bullets kill,
to teach a communications class for engineering students.
I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)
But as these conversations unfolded,
So I think these are just a few keys that can help
Thank you. (Applause)
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything
and that is going to equal incredible interactions
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists
and your jargon, divide by relevance,
and that your engineering is engaging.
this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. (Laughter)
to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
and create a deeper sense of understanding
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations
A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much
And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.
First question to answer for us: so what?
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,
You can clearly communicate your science
that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy
much more effective. It's showing that the special structure
with the students. I was amazed at the ideas
and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.
and if we don't know about it and understand it,
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that
and multiply it by the passion that you have for
of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.
I experienced what Alice must have when she went down
And I believe the key to opening that door
Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say
on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.
as non-scientists to have these interactions.
but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones
"space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved
Five years ago, I experienced a bit
to environment to health care, among others,
then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? (Laughter)
as simple as possible, but no simpler.
that is science and engineering.
that are full of understanding.
meaning share what's relevant to the audience,
And I was scared. (Laughter)
and analogies. Those are ways to engage
Our scientists and engineers are the ones
So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.
And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence
Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is

OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?

This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly

And do not get the impression that this is very subjective.
Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it’s all, you know,
This is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?
This is a joke. I’m a biologist, OK?
Now, while the smell wafts over you, let me tell you the history of an idea.
we never mistake it for an S-H, OK?
that you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this:
The bad news is they’re rocket fuels.

So we've got all the elements for our story.
And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" --
So I was thinking of a story where,
Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.

He should not have been surprised.
How come, then, it's not so expected

I would not allow anyone else.
Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings

She's in the studio with him for a long time.
Well, there've been suggestions that
And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look,

I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.
Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?

Perhaps that was the intention.
They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury,

And I thought, well, what is that relationship?
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience,
if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.
So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.
Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?
So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?
How does Vermeer know her?

And at worst, I didn't even want to think about it.
LP: I'd just like to end off by just saying this:
it's not an ordinary thing to do.
I have never in my life felt anything
and the water was completely black.
Lewis Pugh: Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim.
seen less and less sea ice.
There is no possibility that this was going to happen.
We've just seen our first polar bears.
All of us together, we're all on the same ship together.
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy
I really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.
So I decided to do this symbolic swim
And on day four, we decided to just do a quick
and I was in such a state of depression,
There were open patches of sea everywhere.
Well done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis!
and trying to defrost my fingers.
Now is the time to believe.
Fresh water freezes at zero.
I remember just trying to get out of the water.
to try to shake the lapels of world leaders.
Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off!
and what decision are we going to make today
And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me
What had happened is that we are made partially of water,
when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.
I've just come back from giving a series of speeches
And he said that he could actually see an x-ray
ever since, for the last seven years.
And I then went and did a huge amount of training,
and there were big chunks of white ice in there,
months and months and months of dreaming to get here,
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down
of what happened there on the ice.
South Africa, the Congo.
I dreamed of going to the polar regions.
which was going to the North Pole.
The next morning, I woke up
At the very best, I'm going to end up losing some fingers.
and it was just as the scientists had predicted.
Well, swimming across the North Pole,
and I dived into the sea.
We need to believe in ourselves.
with my father, was just going out the window.
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes.
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me
"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!"
and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.
Man: Take the shoes. Take the shoes.
And I remember standing underneath the hot shower
And after just three minutes in that water,
We're finally at the North Pole. This is
I think we need to do three things.
which have retreated so much.
fell into water of just five degrees centigrade.
and you're going to make a symbolic swim here
And so I now want to show you a short video
Britain, America, Japan,
to get them to understand what is happening.
and pull it through with you.
Narrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage
and saying it doesn't even exist.
And it was so beautiful that I've been back there
It couldn't be further from the truth for me.
and I then got into my swimming costume
was in a national park.
I had to see my coach screaming for me,
but actually you're on fire.
And so ever since I think I was just six years old,
that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.
And I remember looking into the ice,
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy
We are going to actually have to take them off."
And that is, "What type of world do we want to live in,
He could tell a story about an event,
So myself and the five members of the team,
And they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them.
what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?
and people heckling me in the back
And we need to do something about it right now.
you just dive into the sea and off you go.
We all got down onto the ice,
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.
I have swum in front of glaciers
The passengers who fell off the Titanic
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth.
that you're in freezing cold water,
And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders
because you need to be able to grab the water
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole.
and the light was so intense,
I've known you since you were 18 years old.
they all have a very, very good grasp
But I have seen that place change
Every holiday I had as a young boy
for one kilometer across the North Pole.
of us being able to save these fingers.
We stand at a very, very important moment in this history,
Just scuttle forward and go for it."
every single country is going to have to make cuts.
and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.
I'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.
He was a great storyteller.
and we need to do something about it.
So we stopped the ship, as you do.
And then we walked out onto the ice.
And people ask me, "Lewis, what can we do about climate change?"
And it was -- the paradox is
had swollen so much that they were like sausages.
and I can't feel my hands after five minutes,
I remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change,
But seven years ago, I went to the Arctic
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport,
and he came up to me and he said, "Lewis,
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.
And equally, when it comes to climate change,
walking all the way to the South Pole
I felt confident that I could actually
And for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands
because he knew me so well.
And he said that the explosion was so loud
Climate change is for real,
in those types of conditions.
And they had burst. And I was in so much agony.
about what is happening in the Arctic.
and even in those poorest conditions,
had a very, very big impact on my late father.
and within seconds my hands were numb.
"Ran, there is no possibility
This is such an important swim.
And I said to myself, "Lewis, don't look left, don't look right.
and turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.
It's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought.
in such a short period of time.
for a dream to come true.
A number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.
Amundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready.
I have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice
This morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.
And I had to visualize the swim.
from which my team came from.
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.
23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover
And the message was very clear:
because it's just impossible to train
And my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking,
which measures my core body temperature
Man: Against the current! You did it against the current!
He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott
And then, after a year of training, I felt ready.
And all I could think of was, if that happened to Ran after three minutes,
And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that,
they could become extinct.
at how far we have come
There are very, very few people who don't know now
Four or five children sitting behind a desk,
just in that short period of time.
to prepare myself for what was going to happen.
He went to a local hospital and there they said,
And I realize the reason why you're going to do this.
across the most northern place in the whole world.
and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.
LP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.
He had been there and watched it go off.
And, well, sometimes it takes a long time
that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.
For those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.
And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor,
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off
And it is 4,200 meters deep.
LP: How on earth did we do that?
Those flags represented the countries
is, I think, we must all walk to the end of our lives
In the two years before my swim,
It's fucking freezing.
and looking down at my hands in sheer shock,
And to think that in 30, 40 years
but which now is rapidly unfreezing.
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole.
But was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.
beyond all description,
27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.
I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.
that he had to return to England.
Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.
He also told me about the great explorers.
And I remember then getting out of the shower
which drew me to it.
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.
I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,
And so what had actually happened is
and I put on my swimming costume.
to young children as young as 10 years old.
But the most important thing was to train my mind
I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.
I had never seen black water before.
But the most important thing we must do
swimming across the North Pole,
hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.
A mother and a cub, such a beautiful sight.
The second thing we need to do is
in a sustainable world?"
and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.
because the light was so bright.
I mean, just to put it in perspective,
And I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.
And his hands were so badly frostbitten
You saw during that video all those flags.
And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.
And I remember taking the goggles off my face
because we are going to look after you every moment of it."
was of the first British atomic bomb test.
There was something about that place
to help me with this task.
five minute test swim.
And I went down into my cabin
You did it! You did it man!
It took me four months again to feel my hands.
that you are going to make this swim.
Ever since I was a little girl
where other kids can interact with them
over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese,
The last thing I want to talk about today
Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too.
And I remember thinking about
Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?
So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.
So in the United States today,
They didn't do this with a computer.
does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?
For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues,
that we might not have thought about otherwise.
need to translate to the virtual world.
where characters can be physical or virtual,
And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.
they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.
Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.
So an interesting question is,
Let's think about some other domains,
So changes that children make in the real world
discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task --
and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars.
and it would help motivate you.
we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?
in a way that's not possible today.
So here's the first exploration of this idea,
like looking at a set of objects on the table,
It could help you set goals and track your progress,
in their grandchildren's lives
And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo.
through this technology, in a number of different ways.
The task involved things
was not how much weight people lost,
studying artificial intelligence,
through that dialogue.
that is a core part of their functionality.
being able to be an active participant
where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.
with my own team of incredibly talented students.
with the technology, with a remote collaborator
I am now a graduate student at MIT
even when interacting with a robot.
And it would build a working alliance with you
I actually want them to create those experiences.
and to interact with us like a partner
And through this technology,
into the real world of the child,
now at the media lab
to do a collaborative task
and patients and so forth.
because it turns out people just behave like people
Robots touch something deeply human within us.
that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool
But I want to do more than that.
like sharing a bedtime story.
and literally bring it off the screen
I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots,
when you start a diet-and-exercise program.
but I knew I wanted to build them.
And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is
modeled after trainers
It's turning out now
maybe they can help you manage your weight.
where it's actually their ability
and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house,
what's so engaging about digital media
So over the past several years
because that's the standard intervention you typically get
to engage you in a coaching dialogue
It turns out it's the same for robots.
maintain a diet and exercise program,
a really intriguing social technology,
with their granddaughters, with their friends,
when the character becomes real and enters into their world.
that's really trying to think about how we can take
we could interact with robots.
the world's first social robot.
my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study
And the third was just a pen and paper log,
And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice
maybe a robot can help you
is that robots are actually
I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays
It turns out that kids love it
called Playtime Computing
and with that, the promise of an entirely new way
this is mirroring that situation.
To explore this question,
The quality of advice was identical.
There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues
And then it could help track that for you.
how likable, how engaging,
if robots are persuasive,
through building these systems
Today we know that families are living further and further apart,
ran exactly the same dialogues.
He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.
how much exercise you got.
and they think it's pretty cool.
if we like to cooperate with robots,
where they really feel like they are part of that story,
So what I've learned
When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance,
For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet.
like how many calories you ate that day,
We've invited a lot of kids into this space,
But if robots can be engaging,
(Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!
The next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base.
into our daily lives.
much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick --
You'd use a screen interface to enter information,
So this is a new project.
But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play,
even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.
and would really help people accept robots
you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends,
One case was the robot you saw there, Autom.
I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us
It could share information looking down at a screen.
But we can push this idea further.
(Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo.
which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind.
certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us
and, bam! You're a MeBot --
And as a little girl,
It could make eye contact with you.
like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here --
And now it's got number power.
CB: All right, so Leo and Cookie
open up a browser and jack into a little robot.
of this blended-reality play.
And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.
It turns out that people interacted with the robot
You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot,
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.
that foster creativity and learning and innovation.
the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use --
if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases
my mom can go to her computer,
you get a little more of a boost.
whether it's television or computer games or whatnot.
how long did people interact with these systems.
What about a robot accessory for your cellphone?
I've been fascinated by this idea
because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.
using the same body language,
And we know that as you get older in life,
I like to think of this
Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people
So the first thing I want to look at is how long,
seeing "Star Wars" for the first time,
to learn this or understand this from watching people
is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us
and now it's a big problem with our children as well.
give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.
into the world and back.
And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it.
The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group
for me, robots are all about people.
It turns out it's really hard
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.
Well, one of the things that we've learned
You can imagine maybe these symbols
can literally come off the screen
as a new kind of distance-play technology.
introducing Leo to a new object.
And this is what we see when they use just the screen.
of how valuable and important they thought they were.
maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.
Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?
in becoming our highest and best selves,
This is a robot, Autom.
But what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?"
So I love the idea of thinking about robots
and where the digital content
This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo,
We looked at their desire to cooperate.
and then rating them in terms
And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions,
who's helping us attain our personal goals
So we actually explored this idea in our lab.
to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space
We looked at overall engagement.
this ended up being a survival task --
But robots are still not in our home, ironically.
or whether they are our trusted sidekick
Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how?
to help you form healthy habits.
in telepresence and mixed reality
Cookie Monster is very, very bad.
but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk;
how much empathy did you feel for the other person?
Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.
new kinds of applications for robots.
to feel more deeply connected despite distance,
in the right way at the right time
So we've been exploring a lot of ideas
new questions, new possibilities for robots
We try Skype, we try phone calls,
We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio.
We looked at psychological involvement --
And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study,
but really how long they interacted with the robot.
we can now start to imagine
or whether they're helping us
to be able to help you make the right decision
into these experiences and make them their own.
And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine
of persistence of character across realities.
so they just don't get to see each other that often.
(Video) Scientist: I want to show you something.
So given that key insight,
to become creative and innovative,
To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter,
a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination
Another important idea is this notion
But my parents live thousands of miles away,
They would dress the robots.
Kismet was ready to start interacting with people.
And so whether they're helping us
to understand human behavior.
as in the well-known fairy tale --
that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.
Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad.
with their grandparents.
People would name the robots.
working with other graduate students in the lab --
So one of the things we really wanted to look at
Sort of like a digital Jiminy --
they can relate to it and play with it in a way
and I want them to have a really good relationship
we asked people to rate their quality of interaction
it was completely different.
a lot of programming,
And when it's in their world,
For me, I have three young boys,
So after the interaction,
And when you look at emotional engagement,
where we brought human participants, people, into our lab
What they care about is the robot.
the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching "Star Wars."
and family bonds over distance.
And then the fully expressive MeBot.
I knew robots like that didn't really exist,
to be able to study this question.
And I really want to spark their imaginations
Can you find Cookie Monster?
and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships
and they trusted the robot more.
But I can tell you, the thing that they love the most
a part of that experience.
people rated the robot higher
And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet,
and help us save a galaxy or two.
in the real world with his real toys.
CB: -- the character itself could come into your world?
And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today
to tap into something deeply social within us --
This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today --
maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?
something that would delight us, enrich our lives
People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is,
with my sons, with her grandsons,
Leo, this is Cookie Monster.
Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context.
like, real-world play.
This little robot was somehow able
you can move around, you can gesture --
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface,
this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.
a lot like they respond to people.
is create a really immersive experience for kids,
but they get along great now.
she can now play, really play,
actually really makes a difference.
It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter.
And so in this video here --
what we find is that people respond to robots
but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.
And then finally, what I've been trying to do here
might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start,
So it seems like this physical, social embodiment
This is just like video conferencing today.
But with the robot, you can.
I think that's very, very important.
that not only reduce your quality of life,
My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.
The first was just the screen.
We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.
from watching Matt's reaction.
like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child,
to interact with the participants.
where we put one of three interventions in people's homes
So they are now sending the character back into that world.
But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it
who used one of three different technologies
Robotics had really been about interacting with things,
we did a study in the Boston area
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.
I really want to come up with new ways of children's media
He wants to get your cookies.
I imagine a time not too far from now --
It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table --
We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today,
But one really struck me.
To explore that question,
and build upon them.
He's a scary monster.
is the future of children's media.
I almost lost it this week.
well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.
all the reasons why that was the case.
Small roundabouts are starting to appear.
over two million dollars
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?
to create more sensible traffic flows.
So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.
Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections,
on the minor road entering the major.
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.
fatal crashes down 90 percent.
but there's an excessive proliferation of them.
Discount that back to the present, at five percent:
So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"
that's $51,000 per year.
So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.
and you can exercise your community influence
allowing the major one to have primacy.
it's also about the road.
So, it's logical that you'd have one there,
you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.
meaning stop signs, they save many lives,
just for that sign in each direction.
And you'd still come out ahead.
Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent,
That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,
Can that be accomplished with existing signs?
But you all are members of communities,
and it's always on the minor road,
about the vehicle --
So, unsignalized intersections,
So, take, for example, the three-way intersection.
and then sell it off again.
So, you'd have a little instruction below it,
and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,
of alternating, or taking turns,
And energy efficiency is more than just
But they are not applicable in all situations.
from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.
because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.
don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.
Stop signs were invented in 1915,
than we have in the United States.

till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion
I've had some time to think it over.
cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,
That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,
and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form
and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency
but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.
has found crashes drop 40 percent
That intersection I looked at had about 3,000
So, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.
That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait
that got me thinking.
you could actually buy the property,
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there
They're expensive to install,
is a new type of sign.
A study of 24 intersections
And so, the question is, what does that cost us?
that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.
So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket
to come in from that side road safely.
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.
So, what the world needs now
Roundabouts are much better.
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with
which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,
Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,
much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,
The answer is to enable cars
Cars rarely appear on that third road.
So, why not use a yield sign?
than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.
That would not work.
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,
What's that time worth?
use up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.
So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.
And uncertainty results in caution.
just getting your neighborhood to change these things
This is one in my neighborhood. And they are
for a stop sign, in each direction.
what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."
and unsignalized, which means stop signs.
Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?
What about time and gas?

yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.
so I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will
It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.
And you can have more impact on the environment
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember
of which there are two types: signalized
But the other two are somewhat questionable.
But that's just safety.
the gods and the spirits are still very much there,
in a village of 200 people.
"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum" --
The first problem for that definition
that is, the belief in spiritual agency,
So there's a big change, and that division,
that Christianity has,
But this changes in the late 19th century,
The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God.
the stool that he sat on was blackened
if you think about intellectual life
is that it's an extremely creedal religion.
There are many of them in the British Museum.
and so it can't be good or bad.
You don't have to believe in a God per se,
People have talked about it a lot,
He often jokes that he's one of the world's leading atheists.
It was actually adverted to earlier,
and by the way, there was a person who actually did this.
that intellectual division of labor occurs as I say, I think,

one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere
This was completely unauthorized.
There's a better photo of it.
Everybody else is one of our actors.
One thing the managers were trying to do

Now in the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera,

One person's not that unusual.
And this woman is the star of the video.
We'll act as though we don't know each other.
So that's a still from the video there.
and she was very much onstage,
We had about 80 people show up to participate,
That's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.
So I'd say over the years,
and dancing silently in a park,
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.
We didn't let the stores know we were coming.
and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians,
did not find it particularly funny.
It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon,
to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.
So this project is called Look Up More. We had 70 actors dress in black.
So we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.
but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car.
and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar --
Now this took place in January of 2002.
They're going to be entering this car one by one.
because before it became a shared experience,
because it was dark out, but she was back-lit with florescent lighting,
although no one seemed to care.
and watched what we were doing.
Now you can see the regular employees
The participants at Improv Everywhere events
And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings.
You'll see that start right here.
And of course they don't.
This is the Best Buy in New York City.
And you can see the cops in this footage right here.
Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people
And her reaction inspired me
And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.
The managers and the security guards, on the other hand,
At the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag

So the first project we're going to take a look at
who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well.
So then I gave a new hand signal,
telling everybody the cops were coming, watch out, the cops were coming.
And that's me right there in a brown coat.
It's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.
there were hundreds of people by the end
But also, don't shop.
but that one's always bothered me,
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing.

And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.

Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows --

that is a positive experience for other people.

And I think, as adults, we need to learn
so I decided to create my own in public places.

So I got inspired by that.
And I told people, "Don't work. Don't actually do work.
This goes on for another four stops.

then that's enough for us.
and then exited without revealing what had happened
and I said, "Yes, you are correct.

So the train is now pulling into
So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this.
So a very diverse group of people.
And you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do,
You know, as kids, we're taught to play.
So the video won't show everything.
The next project I want to show
Because I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage,
So she's noticed the unusual thing,
I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop

it was funny and something that she could laugh at.
And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere

The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters
that I happened to stumble upon.
And in fact, several of them went to go get their camera from the break room

and said, "Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today,"
And one morning, I was riding the subway.
is: "These people have too much time on their hands."
or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.
to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people
when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.
So I could do more large-scale projects.
and everybody would point to them.
And we were there probably 10 minutes
This is on the 6 train in New York City.

And then once it became a shared experience,
inspired me to keep doing what I do.

And watching that videotape later that day

So that particular event

I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet,
but surely when their minds are straying away
I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.
and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness
people are less happy when they're mind-wandering
And yet it's not clear what the relationship is
mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,
How does this work? Basically, I send people signals
But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph,
This guy is sitting here working on his computer,
Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less,

Well, how often do people's minds wander?

How does that depend on what people are doing?
in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness,
a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,
and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,
at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.

There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:

Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever

It certainly seems that we're going about our lives,

In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering,
and this is the really important one,
Instead, they agreed to use the title "President" for now,
Now you can learn three interesting things from this.
they had the idea that you could be elected King
who just keeps coming back, "Still on this subject."
who took on Parliament.
the Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster."
And they had to face the question
And everybody got insanely bored, actually,
But to really show you how
And they weren't even being monarchical there,
And, you know, it could have worked.
But the third thing you can learn,
It wasn't until, for example, 1771
because this debate went on for three weeks.
when a government says that this is a temporary measure --
And so, in the end, the Senate won
First of all -- and this is my favorite --
I want to take you back to the United States of America,
words and politics interact,
"a dishonest politician."
They thought it was tried and tested.
but they also wanted it absolutely set down
not bloody President --
newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said,
And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table,
And who's going to take him seriously
regardless of party, platform or principle,
Some people just wanted to call him King.
They said, that's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
just after they'd achieved independence.
What do you call the leader of a republican country?
But now, do you know how many nations have a president?
reality changes words far more
Now I have no idea what "talknophical" is.
is that the title, President of the United States of America,
well, it was a singularity back then.
"A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office
for the freedom of the press.
and the largest economy in the world
And so the Senate won in the end.
They didn't want to call him King
And after three weeks of debate, in the end
like President of the United States of America?
than the term "foreman" or "overseer."
than words can ever change reality.
and that in the intercourse with foreign nations,
in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas.

And it didn't have much more grandeur
and other people, Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington.
but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.
and who, when he wins,
And that's why the Senate objected to it.
Thank you very much.
It's not. It's down to a campaigner
All because they want to sound like
and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won.
And that title was "President."
It was like the foreman of the jury.
Second thing you can learn is that
of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby,
he was brave enough to take them on,
and the one I want to leave you with.
and control reality, but in fact,
doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?
may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity,
the exact words that were said in the debating chamber.
Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality
the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President.
There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils
and all politicians know they have to try and control language.
So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest,
whether under republican or monarchical forms of government,
you can still be waiting 223 years later.
and other people, His Highness George Washington,
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington
the majesty of the people of the United States
This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics,
that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report
Most people think that's down to the metal.
i.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos.
and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff.

through the office of the Chief Magistrate, titles of respectability --
And he was thrown into the Tower of London
Although there was a 19th-century
And what snollygoster means is
And this was actually all down to the bravery
and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title.
And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity --
if he's got a silly little title
the House of Representatives were against the Senate.
I read a diary of this poor senator,
And it was only a few years later
which might have made it.
most pathetic title that they could think of.
this is the point I want to leave you on,
Chief Magistrate Washington,
And that's the important lesson I think you can take away,
They got their title of respectability.
And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages.
Something to do with words, I assume.
the President of the United States of America.
Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur.
just waiting for the Senate to spring into action.
Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time,
And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that

It just changes the same content.

But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white,

Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment

and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah,"
between people across all of London, and so leadership,
You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
That was the computer we knew.
It's about something in between.
And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove,

I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop?
and you might want to look into different areas. For instance,
Text first, then images, we waited,
So you can see how you change the scale, you change
he bought me a computer, and some of you remember
You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso,
It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter
about technology, design and art, and how they intersect,
and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass,"
and that was really bad.
and the game was as such:
You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect,
You know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days.
You see it in all interesting art today, in all
You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road,
And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine
People ask me why I made that. It's not clear. (Laughter)
By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art,
What is the tenor of their email? How is it working out?
You change the typeface to, like, this typeface,
When that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.
and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface,
It's because leaders, what we do is we connect
and here you see one person who crosses the two areas
When we look at an antique we want,
connecting people, is the great question today.
And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson.
So art makes questions, and
improbable connections and hope something will happen,
It's peaceful, like that. (Laughter)
In each country, I'm sure you have this thing called
type on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out.
But I would listen to people, hear their issues,
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference?
they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic,
So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time.
I'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know.
and it was the best sign ever to say no.
You'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.
and in that room I found so many connections
And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
and have looked to design, as we understand most things,
make things happen? So for instance, you might open up
Not the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child,
and know that you know someone in Eco, over here,
And he saw, over and over, the antique's value
It's kind of stressful typing out, so if you

Like, we gotta go to Fear. (Laughter)
So that was 20 years ago, and
Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal,
going to MIT, my father's dream. And at MIT, however,
If you just change one letter in that content,
It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward.
and you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear.
And so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.
They're targeted social media systems around leaders.
So in closing, I want to thank all of you
and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.
and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
since four years ago I became the President
I love the French film "The Red Balloon."
whereas a creative leader hopes to be right.
to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design,
People say, "Wow, your art, what is it?" It's new media.
It's called "Tap, Type, Write."
It would say you're wrong most of the time.
The first three things are about how I've been curious

This is called Powershop, and the way it works is
Well, content is the word up there: fear.
And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named

"Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old." (Laughter)
green are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly.
And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver,
and I've just begun thinking like this,
this is sort of like a play on that. (Typing noises) (Typewriter bell)
so this is 20 years ago. I made a computer out of people.
It's, like, amazing, right? (Laughter) (Applause)
This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont

Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy,
and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.
And this frame is important today, in this complex,

So my view is: Be optimistic.
Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.

Now think what this means.
In 1990, exports from China to the United States:

about what do they think great art is.
because of the forbidden fruit.
And then I realized one day, there's an easier solution to this.
the attention that we got.
This is from a short film of hers called "The Last Person."
I know I should mention: I'm making all these things.
What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him.
And he spends that week talking to the family
everything they say is fallen
and find these artists?
who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction --
Next is Ginger Cheshire.
So I should talk about art.
And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition
And if the TV was on, we were watching a documentary.
This project is called "Love Nests."
And also they reference how the uvula --
how am I going to travel the world
I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home
so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.
This is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.

we were big readers in our house.
that they use the uvula for.
how am I going to do this biennial,
and they needed funding for it,
And I was like, "Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work."
The next artist is K. M. Yoon,
But on the other side of that, though,
and outdoor installations like this one
like in his series where he used rain to make paintings.
I talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.
and she's doing a whole project called "Social Outfits."
He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently.
I felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing.
and he's ready to spend the week with them.
Thank you. Thank you.
Next is by Hilda Singh,
And this one had to get broken up.
called "What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching."
because when I see it I know that's French angora

and this is from a project of hers
and not damage what it was on

and she's interested in ephemerality and transience.
and here she's taking giant mirrors
And she was thinking about her friends and family

And he shows up on their porch, their doorstep,

It would have "heart" in that it would have passion
talk about luck or fate or chance.
The next artist is Kay Overstry,
or they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments.
and also more intellectual than you would ever expect.
And then at the other end, there's performance and short films
and I started making their work.
he spends a week at a time with a family.
and decided, "You know, I would learn a lot about culture
And after this one, there's 77 other artists.

And that was played by my mom.

And my childhood is more hick
And what he does is --
And this is by Cicily Bennett,
And she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists,
So this piece was great fun
and it's an heirloom that you pass down.
He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese
well it was pretty kickass; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun --
and using it to cleanse barren ground.
Next is Sylvia Slater.
And what they've done

called "Artists in Residence."
The next artist is Hazel Clausen.

She heals with color.
And I love to dig a hole.
So hopefully what happens is you never use it,
And what was amazing to me --
This is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.
I invented a hundred artists from around the world.
So this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.
because I grew up around quirky, colorful characters
Well this has sparked a craze in Japan,
And this one's called "Lovemaking Nest."
So for example, in realist paintings,

This artist is Gus Weinmueller,

Nell is interested in agricultural processes,

and, bless his heart, he's so paranoid.
he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun.
This is Nell Remmel.
This one's called "Mixtape Love Song's Nest."
And so this is what I did.

when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark,
But when I was little, I remember,
And this one's called "Lovelock's Nest."

that are portraits of the person that would carry them.
He can read a novel or two a day.

I was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum.
So I should start to talk about these guys.
I'm just going to make the whole thing myself.
and it hasn't been refined enough yet.
And it's good that she's not real;
was some more exquisite craftsmanship
So what they do is they move into an area
And that's my cousin and my sister's dog, Gabby.
And probably the best part of this piece

And the second thing that I was longing for

and they had the questions there, millions answered,

And then, lately, from the European Union media.

You see, the problem is not that people

Ola Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,
scale it up to all domains

The right answer is probably the one
The problem is that the media doesn't know themselves.
and people will read it because it's sensational.

and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling
And we go to the next question.
and I think there were about 2,000 comments,
and we then get an illusion of confidence
This is the best data from the disaster researchers,
Actually, it has exactly the same problem
We have a personal bias.
Oh, very, very good.
The world was two groups.
Okay, this was good evolutionarily,
to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.
but schooling is there in the world today.
somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.
and especially things we're afraid of.
it is the exact reason why it's upside down.
You heard it. You thought it yourself.
Look: that huge hump in the middle

from a conference with U.S. media.
Let's look at the next answer here: women in school.
What shall we do about this, Ola?
which is to sit down late nights
That's a systematic approach.
You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.
Well, congratulations, you're twice as good as the Swedes,
He's cofounder and director,

deaths from natural disasters in the world,
You were beaten by the chimps.
Now the question, is this important?
in Gapminder Foundation that we run,
and there are organizations trying to spread
like electricity and girls in school, these kinds of things.
Of course there are dangerous things that are also great.
There must be preconceived ideas, you know.
you know what the right answer is.
most countries, girls today go to school
So as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of,
Use this device. Use this device to answer.
However, Ola's approach
Did it more than double,
So you're sitting with a question in front of you
that makes us humans, our human intuition.
When you answer, you answer according to the worst places,
Now, we miss the majority.
People don't have that time.
Everything is getting worse.
or did it decrease to less than half?
So by measuring it we can understand
Sharks kill very, very few. That's how you should think.
the fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?
So how come? I think it's like this,
and in U.S., when we asked the public,
for beating the chimps in the future.
and you're unsure. You should guess "improve."
Then, I will equip you with some tricks
That's basically what I will do.
with the terrible results,
and now they describe this world to the students
and I selected the West.
that so many remain in extreme poverty.
So we have these outdated facts
gender equality, energy, finance.
If you have a fact-based worldview of today,
So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.
such as climate, endangered species, human rights,
Fifty percent thought it had doubled,
a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,
That's a rule of thumb.
That will help you score better on our tests.
And they are exaggerated,
That's nice. So what's going to happen next?
who live in extreme poverty change?
It's the number of people on each income,
and that is very clearly shown in this question.
Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.
In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived
in the world go to school:
It gave me a very biased view
In 1900, there was about half a million people
So that's what we are focusing on.
Let's see, let's see. Here we come.
These are just projections of GDP per capita into the future.
and the idea is really to
No, no, no. That's wrong.
And this is you. Here you come.
but that can be ended now.
In 2025, 63 percent.
A, B or C? Please answer.
seven years, five years or three years?
who score like chimpanzees.
and asking them, what are your favorite facts
When we realize that actually it's succeeding, we can understand it.
But first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,
The Swedish public answered like this:
and how to bring girls in school.
who cares about the rich end of this scale?
and it's a neighborhood with a large problem.
where you grew up as well.
and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter
No — well, yes, but they are not so important
Unusual events are more interesting, no?
It was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it?
So if you are unsure, go for the
But this has changed, okay?
Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?
where most people in the world live,
Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you
Extreme poverty — not having enough food for the day.
Please answer A, B or C.
and it goes up and down,
There is, of course, one way,
assuming the income inequality of each country is the same.
of people in the world
And then, how did that change?
They cannot generalize these kinds of rules.
Ah, you almost made it to the chimps.
and it all starts in this place.
You must have higher ambitions in the world.
and then there was one hump here
We're going back to these two humps in 1975.
This is very widespread.
the world population has grown,
Yeah, it's important to understand poverty,
Look here. This is how it was in 1975.
This is how they answered.
Let's start with the first misconception.
in terms of how rich you are.
But in the majority of the world,
That little, just a few of you!
Of course you shouldn't.
because the chimps cannot do this.
because they don't even know what has happened.
These are the people who can afford
where girls have great difficulties.
and jump to conclusions very, very fast.
But is it important for everyone else
what is the pattern of ignorance.
How are you going to succeed?
It's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.
What happens next is news, okay?
But look how this has changed:
See, there was one hump here,
Yeah, it's an unequal world,
around one dollar a day,
And we go to the next question.
"Yeah, I drive cars better."
anything that makes me feel,
The Western domination is over, as of today.
"the majority already have this,"
Yes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.
of how life is on this planet.
and we seek causality where there is none,
They are stopped when they go to school,
So first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.
in the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.
Still it's appalling
so we have to think about preconceived ideas,
where we believe that we are the best car drivers,
but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,
without any bad intentions,

with the same speed, just as an experiment what might actually happen.
in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project
and one of the main preconceived ideas
The trends that are increasing are instead falling,
Okay, I gather those facts.
As I go forward, what has changed,
We need to turn our intuition into strength again.
I would say yes, extremely important,
three multiple choice questions.
but that's not enough.
and CNN published these results on their web
Okay, this little shortlist, what are we going to do with it?
to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.
but when you look at the data, it's one hump.
and on top of this, we start school,
It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,
a lot of ignorance across the whole world,
I see lots of answers. This is much faster than I do it at universities.
what's coming next in the future.
They are so slow. They keep thinking, thinking, thinking.
The percent in poverty has decreased.
So how do we solve such problems?
which might be earthquakes, other religions,
The lower humps merged with the upper hump,
You were three times better than the Swedes,
that everyone is aware that there are countries
and those books, of course, that are printed
go for "the most people are in the middle."
So maybe 10 years from now,
So now I'm going to show you some tricks
We started the pilot last year,
which you think the public doesn't know?
So we get a shorter list
That's when I was born,
they choose by random, so the Swedes answer worse than random.
were really hard to get away from.
like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.
where the misconceptions are turned around
and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?
did it remain more or less the same,
Of course they think so,
So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.
This is the U.S. public.
as long as boys, more or less.
and it was started, this project, last year
So Ola told me, "Take these devices.
Well, we asked the Swedes like this,
and see where they score worst.
They're only rules of thumb,
It's a terrible inequality.
And hopefully we can turn your world around
you will be sitting in an interview

and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.
If something, yes, this is a good one,
It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.
Okay? If you feel unsure,
we have to be more systematic
if this project succeeds,
like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,
and there were fewer in between.
to protect people from this, you know.
first countries and people need to be very, very rich
to keep the teaching material up to date.
We have all different experiences
and in this case, the chimps use our intuition against us,
the poor ones and the rich ones,
The other way to think is, most things improve.
First, we need to measure it,
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden.
Fortunately, I will be able to comfort you
That's the current EU countries and North America.
so of course they don't apply to everything,
and it's down to much less than half.
extreme poverty and how to fight it,
from communities and people we meet,
Look at the Swedish result:
In 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest.
Now, this is what the U.S. public and the Swedish answered.
you might have a chance to understand
having to fill out this crazy global knowledge.
Give it to them and measure what the media know."
like some few examples from Hans,

It was good in evolution.
20, 50 or 80 percent?
Let's now see how the rest and the West compares
How long did women go to school?
and this was one of the comments.
2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is outnumbered in the rich consumer market.
The challenge we have now
A shark attack on a Swedish person
So these three skewed sources of information
Here, you can see men went eight years.
you could probably answer better than the chimps,
Everybody answered that question,
for the first time, the informal results
So now we come to the practical tricks.
Okay? Don't go for the worse.
We still have this group, almost a billion, over there,
and there you are right, but you miss the majority.
All different sectors have facts,
It helped us generalize
and it goes to the Second World War,
they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.
So already the pilots reveal this,
So yes, I think it's a good idea for a company to use this certificate
which you can use, if you're a large organization,
did it remain about the same in the world as a whole,
into rules of thumb.
and on top of it we put the very thing
I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.
So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this.
We asked, what is the percentage of the world's
That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,
People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.
Basically meaning, we don't hire people
We need to be able to generalize.
Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen.
They have a forecast for the next five years of GDP per capita.

So I've started actually contacting some of them,
The first thing to think about the future
Now, the next preconceived idea is

They still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,

That will never happen, actually.
but this is how you can generalize.

outside EU and North America.
Do we have any ideas?
Bruno Giussani: Hans and Ola Rosling!
"I bet no member of the media passed the test," he said.
as the decades go by
is to get away from that, understand where the majority is,
how did that change during the last century?
So I can use that to go five years into the future,
and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world
That's going to help you get the answer right.
that so many in the public score worse than random,
Seventy-three percent of the rich consumers
Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,
when we fight devastating ignorance.
You are invited to media conferences.
I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF, International Monetary Fund, website.
Well, it's very clear that poverty here

and learn all the facts by heart
because they learned something when they went to school,
38 percent said it's more or less the same,
and that gives you a hint, doesn't it?
So how long did women 30 years old
It was not representative. Okay?
to really measure what we know made headlines,
maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,

In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool --

My friends, the doodle has never been

Additionally, I've heard horror stories
People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information

And finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this,

This is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blair
There are four ways that learners intake information

I think that means doodling is native to us
So I discovered some very interesting things.
And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition,
but this made me cry when I discovered this.
Additionally, it has a profound effect
because it's considered to be anti-intellectual
And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst,
Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.

No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.

People who sell us fossil fuels.
I think that's the most important thing that people have,
that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.
and this will start out, first of all, showing you the nest entrance.
dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs.
gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest, and store them.
my first question was, "What's the relationship
are not any older than the ants in the younger colony.
And the pattern of these interactions determines
So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer.
And this is true of most ants --
and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks.
and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it.
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on
And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down.
There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives --
produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork.
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.
So, the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable
the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change,
they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil
And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection
And it would change as the colony gets larger.
And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce.
It could be this year, or this year.
That is to say, if something happened -- and I've never seen anything like this happen,
So this is a one-year-old colony -- this happens to be 536.
The queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs.
that's because the longer an ant stays outside,
But in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers,
Ants never make more ants; colonies make more colonies.
That is, that there are chambers inside,
So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony.
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens,
They somehow get into this reserve.
So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen,
moment to moment whether to be active or not.
and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it --
and the queen never comes out again.
So there's this whole network of chambers.
And after that, the males all die. That's it for them.
And we've done experiments that show that
So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony.
And so what the message is, is not any message
produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants.
So that's not the most fun part of this research, although it's interesting.
And finally, it looks like each ant is deciding
as they would to contact with real ants.
Often the queens mate more than once.
And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which.
like "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds."
So, with nobody telling anybody what to do, how is it that
that would have the outcome that I see,
It's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways.
But the idea is that the ants are in there,
and we have this three-color system.
brains, cells, developing embryos.
so this is about 10,000 worker ants --
just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope.
they're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants.
So for example, if I put out extra food, everybody else --
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.
And lately we've gotten more sophisticated
and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule,
Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest,
There are many biological systems like that --
So, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.
In the beginning you see the ants
and there are many others. The web is one.
are contacting the ants coming in.
about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.
Then, as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge,
The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life.
And she's in the process of mating with this male,
and I suspect in others as well --
They cover the earth, except for Antarctica.
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts,
the more I hassle them, the more they act like undisturbed colonies.
they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest.
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.
was that ants actually switch tasks.
and by coming back -- just by making it back --
and sort of performed independently of the others,
and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess.
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age
the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside.
and much more homeostatic. The worse things get,
She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves.
And finally, the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage.
with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor.
There's a lot of damage to the nest,
So, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that,
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance
each ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.
And this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings.
put it down, turn around, and go back in.
are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size.
and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before,
you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence
And they sort of stand as a buffer in between
There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest.
because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming,
That is, to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight.
Each ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.
This is a five-year-old colony. This is the nest entrance, here's a pencil for scale.
But if more nest maintenance work is needed --
as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences,
And then there's another long tunnel and a chamber, where we often find the queen,
And this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks.
And we've just recently demonstrated this
and they all fly to a common place. And they mate.
here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited --
that they start to reproduce.
When I do these experiments with older colonies --
the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol.
then I see fewer ants out foraging.
and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles.
So the one thing, though, that I want you to remember about this
The patrollers -- that's supposed to be a magnifying glass --
and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate
So it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts, perfection arises.
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought
And the obvious thing that's changing is its size.
must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting.
and other ants come up from below, get the food,
using the sperm from that original mating.
as the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.
that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up,
keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks.
it's about 250 meters on one side, 400 on the other.
Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing?"
When one ant touches another, it's smelling it,
but they mostly work by smell.
And it's when they reach this stable size, in numbers of ants,
This process changes with colony age, and it changes like this.
so I created a disturbance, so extra patrollers were needed --
So for example, if I make a mess
each colony sends out its virgin, unmated queens with wings, and the males,
And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest,
to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there.
They smell with their antennae.
what is there about the way the colony is organized
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance.
If there's more patrolling to do --
it changes the numbers performing another.
they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow
will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one.
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks
And I think it's a very interesting question --
And here was the most intriguing result: the task allocation.
the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage.
So, an ant starts out somewhere near the queen.
So every year, on the same day -- and it's a mystery exactly how that happens --
Here it is about 40 minutes later.
how is it that an ant can tell, for example, I'm a forager.
into these four categories: where an ant is foraging,
between the ants doing different tasks?
In fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them
Now ants -- most ants, including these, don't see very well.
It's not due to the experience of older, wiser ants.
I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.
But in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there.
But the foragers somehow decide not to come out.
whether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.
And they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons --
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings
This is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.
But first you might be wondering:
of the ants I see just outside the nest
That's not just how is the colony organized,
all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.
And it stays that size until the queen dies
Like I just said, if there is more food to collect, the patrollers, the midden workers,
So that's only about 25 percent of the colony, and they're the oldest ants.
well it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent.
So this is the kind of rule that, as the colony develops and gets older and larger,
those are the ones with wings -- on a mating flight.
And I'll tell you a little bit more about that.
And in harvester ants, I divide the tasks
if something happened, they might all come out if they were needed.
it's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that.
And so just to summarize the result,
early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active.
The pattern itself is the message.
might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns --
And they forage maybe for about 20 meters away,
So when I first set out to work on task allocation,
And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.
and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers.
and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.
but I've only been looking for 20 years --
a stream of contacts with other ants.
There's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.
But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works.
And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere, drop their wings,
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest.
and they work really well.
just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet.
And that's the process that I call task allocation.
So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do,
The patrollers become foragers.
So I want now to show you a bit of film --
and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers,
by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance,
that they transmit from one ant to another, but the pattern.
This is the nest of the mature colony, and there's the nest entrance.
The first is that the experience of the ant -- of each ant -- can't be very predictable.
The nest maintenance workers become foragers.
So that's what the midden workers do.
We started out with model airplane paint
the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task?
these predictable dynamics, in who does what task.
Again, I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions
in fact, you could think of those ants as reserves.
they become foragers.
they'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.
So for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers
And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds.
There are about 10,000 species of ants.
And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.
changes as a function of colony age, in years.
They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest,
occasionally the colony has to go down deep.
the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food,
On one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day
is different as ants perform different tasks.
as the colony gets older and larger.
and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house.
So I did experiments where I changed one thing.
that this pattern of haphazard contacts, in the aggregate,
the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest.
So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger.
about, you know, "Look to the ant, thou sluggard,"
but instead because when there's flooding,
with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it,
and there's another male on top waiting his turn.
the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do.
and the rabbit just happens to be there.
then extra ants are allocated to collect the food.
in the aggregate, produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies.
you never see them deep down.
the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable.
So, despite what it says in the Bible,
and my crew of students with pickaxes,
these hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants,
And because of that, I've been able to study how their behavior changes
And instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?"
Something that they're doing is clearly successful enough
Here's my study site. This is really a picture of ants,
and this is what everybody knows about picnics --
there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see
rules could an ant could be using, since no ant can assess the global situation --
because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants. (Laughter)
Whereas the young, small colonies --
So foraging acts as a sink, and the ants inside the nest act as a source.
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact
So here's some blue nest maintenance workers.
And by doing this I know how old they all are.
they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out.
knowing its place on the assembly line.
When extra food becomes available --
And if you mark ants that are working outside, and dig up a colony,
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes --
I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony --
on a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona.
to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to,
to decide whether to go out on their next trip,
and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked.
And we've learned that, in this species --
and figure out which ones have died, and put all the new ones on the map.
Ants have been around for several hundred million years.
And I've been working for the past 20 years
to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers
what kinds of decision rules -- very simple, local, probably olfactory, chemical
This is about as big as they get, about a meter across.

a forager and a nest maintenance worker.
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go,
was somehow dedicated to its task from birth
But it works pretty well.
So, we do a lot of simulation and modeling, and also experimental work,
they're much more consistent from one time to another
for example, if I put out a bunch of toothpicks --
And the second result, which was surprising to a lot of people,
by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads,
is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"
So it has to know the difference between
before the foragers are active.
And I try to figure out how that works.
When it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert.
so ones that are five years or older --

So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand,

So, things happen to an ant colony.
So since I've had this result, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out

So the queen goes down in there.
And every colony has a name, which is a number,
And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant
No ant directs the behavior of any other ant.
And what I wanted to know was, "OK,
But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers,
the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change?
that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing?
They make a midden, a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat.
They've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet

The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management.

And in particular, how the simple parts of organizations
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.
And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep
to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies.
This is just a road. And it's not very big:
when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing?
because they never seem to be doing anything
Nobody tells anybody what to do.
How is it that the colony manages to adjust
They have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark,
Instead, something about the organization
And the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern
There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber,

this network of interaction patterns --
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site.
So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae.
but how does it change what it's doing?
and there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old.
This is a three-year-old colony.
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
So, if I change the numbers performing one task,

Well, there's two principle ways.
And the second is a phenomenon
So we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands,

Let's have the next video.
I realized the importance of environmental issues,

And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.
TM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other.
and what was important. And to my surprise,
and did not -- the way I approached it, first,
And they form little groups, all fighting with each other,
and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.
The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.

Okay, this one will be a left turn.
I'll give you a demonstration of how it works.

which I just thought was a lot of fun,
So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight --
that could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?
that's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,
But this last time, just coming round, right now,
We're in charge. It's frightening.

The thing that is exciting was, in 1976,
to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.
So I can do it -- oops, that was going to be a right turn.
And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,
and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,

and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.
which is what the government was trying to do with it.

And so, the year 2000, you see there.

And two weeks after this drawing was done,

and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
the power to fly would be decreased a little bit,
And we developed the impact car that General Motors made,
but got tangled up with some great professor types,
and then other planes,

As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop
we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,
Suddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species,

And this, we just wanted to show you --
And you don't know what the future will hold,
but all the professionals in the field hated each other,
We didn't -- a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work,
But while this was going on,
We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,

and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,
and traffic jams and so on.
on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life --

and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,
We had AirDynamisis,
It turned out that giving the planes to the museum

We focused more on the really serious energy problems
I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,

And when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.
I wanted to show the slide --
AA: They called it their Walkalong Glider.
And then, navy pilot training, and, after college,

And that project continued, did succeed,
and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then --
Paul MacCready: The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think.
the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.
And we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.
and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.
That plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.
and maybe help that field.
Approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,
you can see how it just can fly around,
and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.
I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane
and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.
that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.
AA: When they got bored with their father's project,
70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,
This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,
from solar energy and water, and so on.
Eventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,

Now they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth.

Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets
And then also, like it said in the video,
We're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus
And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,
and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,
PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications,
which had then been around for -- (Laughter) --
we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,
Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought about
if we can get the video running on this, yeah --
and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.

it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.
Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.
As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,
in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation --
Rachel Carson was thinking of these, and came out with "Silent Spring," way back.
What's the population of the Earth going to be
on some big, many year project,
so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.
so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,
I thought back about if I was a space traveler,
and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,

It is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.
But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,
And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.
was worth much more than the debt,
of vertebrates on land and air.
and so on. And everybody would talk to me,
of the future, and we produced products for the company.
I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,
and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,
and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane
and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.
on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,
and we won the prize a year later.
and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.
and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.
nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem.
so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
TM: Oh, 10, 11. (AA: Oh my God.)
So this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years,

to maximize the power from her solar array.
The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,
But that sure started me thinking about various things,
Humans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass
I could go around to the various talks that were being given,
for flying the English Channel, 21 miles.

We, NSA, have not done a good job of that,
One way, and probably the most common way

The other thing I would say is that

That's not an NSA thing.

What metadata lets you do is connect that.

CA: You're sitting there with the American flag,
that was attributed in the press to North Korea

Do you see, has that kind of possibility
I think there's also an amazing arrogance
I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons.
I don't think that's the right framing.
and beyond that, the privacy of citizens
because in the core data
CA: So in terms of the threats

Is there any internal debate about that?

sorry, I'm getting feedback

to provide them with information
I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading.
and it impacts, it's not just NSA,
in areas like the cloud and Internet-based technologies.
that he could have done that
with a Wiper-style virus.
in their home countries.
I think that's extremely arrogant on his part.
it's not just the government,
the threats that are coming their way.
So I'm not presupposing any outcome,
two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,
and I think that the NSA provided

and the communications that we use with our allies,
to a country like Iran or North Korea,
and the effects of these programs,
there are things that we need to be transparent about:
don't rely on sound bites,
for manufacturing or developing those products.
CA: Thank you, Rick.
I think this is a really important conversation
a lot of people who look at risk
including some of our allied countries,
It's certainly quite a strong statement
some of which are our allies,
and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out,
or bioterrorism act or something like that
actually is privacy-enhancing.
I think cyber is a threat in three ways:
what's the correct thing to do.
almost a difference of opinion
RL: I don't really understand that argument.
we compel them to provide information,
who think very differently about the Internet.
you watch a murder mystery.
to have insight into what they're doing.
So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.
for doing what he did,
With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are
CA: Now, you mentioned the threat of cyberattacks,
all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,
and so it's in our interest
We didn't realize that he was going to show up there,
but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity,
Again, that's a nation-state who is executing those attacks,
in a way that allows the people that we're all working against,
and show a more open face here.
and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place,
Is there anything to that?
I think your boss, General Keith Alexander,
which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.
and so we have to swim in that same space.
The needle was found by other methods.

because of the fact that he put people's lives at risk,

would you entertain any discussions
but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,
not that I have the capability itself.
I said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.
RL: So that's out of my lane.
Second is the denial-of-service attacks.
because the companies,
that took out thousands of computers.
RL: No, there's actually two programs
there are a number of inspectors general.
Those are on the rise,
And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure,
or in some cases the United States,

And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability
It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past,

This is a legitimate activity
Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.
And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.
that lets us think about what other people are thinking.
And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall.
and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.
So which one do you think Ivan is going to take?
and they take a break for coffee.
We have a special brain system
and ask how people's judgments change.
When you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.
"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?"
And so Ivan goes to get a drink.
to think about other people's thoughts.
they still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.
simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,
and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.
or what this man is.
the friend drank the coffee and died,
Or perhaps, more relevantly,
Ivan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
getting into early adolescence,
RS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't.
whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.
He says the wind should get in trouble
learn language and abstract concepts,
to guess what this woman is thinking,
but someone could take this knowledge
to know what somebody else wants or believes?"
And Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch."
people come, actually, especially well equipped
It takes children a long time to break into the system.
Child: No, because the wind should get in trouble.
First, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.
how brains do the uniquely human things --
one snapshot of a stranger,
Uh-oh. Why did he take that one?
I mean, you're clearly an incredible human being,
which is, "Why is it so hard
getting them wrong again."
So what I've told you today is that
we weren't always that way.
to ask if we can change people's moral judgments.
in understanding what seems an impossible problem?
So I'm going to show you a demo of this.
and asking children now, not for an action prediction,
We changed their ability to judge other people's actions.
you need almost no information,
And he takes this one.
wondering where this work leads.
So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed
and then on careful reconsideration,
And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.
So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version
are really good at understanding other minds,
now applied to the RTPJ,
is going to come up with some paradigm shift
when they're making action choices.
So to start with an illustration,
I really love cheese sandwiches."
And we can use that same pulse,
someone, you or someone else,
that we get what looks more like an adult response.
and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.
of learning to think about other people's thoughts
to know other minds?"
and he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!
people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.
The second thing I want to say about this brain system
that at some time in your career,
And so, it is not until age seven
And we can see the continuation of this process
And that problem is, "How is it so easy
There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us
RS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich,
it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts --
I mean, what chances do you think there are
between people, in how we judge others,
through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,
is not what I meant."
is how much activity there was in this brain region,
CA: They really are calling?
and that I don't have to worry about this.
And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults
Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand
And then finally, to show that some of the differences
for taking Joshua's sandwich?
This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse
were the things that any other animal's brain could do too,
but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard
So what I'm showing you, from left to right,
Now of course, development doesn't end at five.
Which sandwich is he going to take?
that many people in this audience have a mind,
And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.
They're MIT undergraduates.
RS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty
Until recently, what we knew about the brain
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich.
the brains of people while they're making that judgment.
But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds,
RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.
but for today's purposes I'm going to assume
And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.
and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying,
Child: What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.
at thinking of other minds, how often they do it
for putting the powder in the coffee.
in a group of what we call typical human adults.
as we learn how to do this difficult job.
why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich.
It's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,
because now it's dirty, on the ground.
And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside
this is, of course, a problem I confront every day.
who got the same puzzle.
even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.
So that's a problem in philosophy,
"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches."
And she puts it in her friend's coffee.
And you know what pirates really like?
people differ from one another in how good they are
And this picture shows the average activation
Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things
Some observations on the slow development of this system
Remember the five-year-old completely understood
And we do have such a tool.
the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,
and other people less.
The changes I showed you are impressive to me
So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,
being used while children are thinking about other people.
for thinking about other people's thoughts.
But now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.
and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.
Some people think she should deserve more blame,
Please tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say.
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.
in how we think about and judge other people.
But of course, as you're probably aware,
where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,
So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse.
about the discovery of a special brain region
The whole research program here of studying
in the accident case.
But the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison,"
can explain differences among adults
that we call the false belief task.
So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,
to the part of my brain that controls my hand.
where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,
about exactly how much blame Grace should get
So it's not a surreptitious technology.
that sounds alarming.
who is getting a standard kind of puzzle
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm,
The notion that you can understand
and mice and even sea slugs.
People, though, disagree a little bit
One is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.
So I'm going to show you a five-year-old
or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.
that puzzles a lot of people.
Obviously the whole project here is huge.
that we share with all other animals, with monkeys
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,
Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one.
is not the familiar one from philosophy,
slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.
or when you read Romeo and Juliet
and ask what's going on in their brain
the hard problem of consciousness,
a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?
"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business
RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.
And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar
This system takes a long time to develop,
And the problem I'm going to talk about
Grace goes to make the coffee
And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,
is to put children into the brain scanner
CA: So I've got one last question. There is this thing called
Like Philip Roth, who said,
Child: I think he is going to take that one.
RS: It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing.
of understanding it.
It's above and behind your right ear.
And now what we've started to do in my lab
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?
people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,
the machine that we use for thinking about other minds,
do acts that people here might be worried about.
I think novelists put this best.
And while Ivan is away
The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,
And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood
It's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.
And we don't know yet what the implications will be
Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,
CA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations
And put another way, the crux of the problem is
So the three-year-old does two things differently.
people say Grace deserves less blame in that case,
not-torture chamber,
The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.
This is a picture of it.
for switching the sandwiches.
and thinking about other people's thoughts -- that's brand new.
RS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?
but studying the jury.
where everything in the real world is the same.
So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory,
I'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.
And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.
So first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again.
studying the defendant in a criminal trial,
Child: His was on the grass.
And we can compare that to another case,
And I'm going to give that to you now.
So these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.
And to try to understand how you can put together
but for a moral judgment.
people paid little attention to her innocent belief
And so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as
So even though when the powder was poison,
RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.
in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?
of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.
And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,
there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,
when there was very little activity in this brain region,
but actually the powder was poison.
Child: So he won't know which one is his.
the age range of the children I just showed you.
And the whole project of understanding
So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?
is to stand with these ideas,
And what you can see is, on the left
because it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine,
RS: That's exactly right.
when they are age five to eight,
and how they hear and sense.
So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience
people said that Grace deserved.
And he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
Where Grace thought the powder was sugar,
you must lie awake at night sometimes
as parents and teachers and spouses
Child: And then his went on the ground.
Okay. Good. (Laughter)
Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong,
be explained in terms of differences in this brain region?
in children it's much less so,
can be explained by differences in this brain system.
We knew how brains see, and how they control the body
and from top to bottom, how much blame
moral judgments when they're deciding what to do,
Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.
which we call an accident.
RS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.
It's getting them wrong that is living.
in how they think about other people's thoughts
by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.
so we could study it in animal models.
And what we changed was not people's
Do you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.
than in another case,
Child: So, that one is his.
for Grace to put the powder in the coffee?
is not what living is all about anyway.
but it was really poison and so she caused a death,
of the moral judgments that we actually make.
and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.
in this case, the failed attempt to harm,
How many people think it was morally permissible
"The fact remains that getting people right
Child: Cheese? I love cheese!
And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar,
this brain region is almost completely specialized --
You're a brilliant young neuroscientist.
but they're small on the scale
And in fact, they say she deserves more blame
So whereas in the adults, as I told you,
Woman (Video): Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.
"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,
because of what they tell us about the function of the brain,
But it's not quite like the adult brain.
Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did,
But I want to give the last word back to the novelists,
people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame
So as a teacher and as a spouse,
Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old
now people say she deserves a lot of blame,
and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.
so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.
Rebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.
So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.
But why does anyone have to feel anything?
and see if we could change people's moral judgment.
the three-year-old comes up with another explanation:
It's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.
and invisible aims."
and what the consequences are for their actions.
That is, maybe you have a mind,
why a brain works, perhaps.
to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.
with function in this brain region,
And yet, you put them together in a particular network,
to envision one another's interior workings
that other people can have false beliefs
Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,
whether other people have minds?"
This pirate is called Joshua.
are continuing, slowly, to develop.
And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.
And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps
since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich
what we'd rather is have a way to interfere
RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.
So ill equipped are we all,
So that's a five-year-old who clearly understands
people say she deserves no blame at all.
which is, "How can we know
containing a white powder, which is sugar.
And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region
and the brain system that supports it
as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.
So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,
to take Joshua's sandwich,
So that's good, but of course
and puts it in her friend's coffee,
magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments,
And now, here comes the other pirate.
our mind's ability to think about other minds,
remain the same. They say she deserves no blame.
CA: That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic.
So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan
for causing the accident.
and no harm occurred.
So, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.
Chris Anderson: So, I have a question. When you start talking about using
and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.
that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.
So their judgments of the case when everything was fine
So I'm going to tell you three things about this today.
and said she deserved a lot less blame
our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,
than in the other case, where she thought it was poison
RS: Yeah, we worry about this.
as kids learn to understand
and even into adolescence,
in education, to perhaps bring up
First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich
when she innocently thought it was sugar,
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.
What would our sleeping patterns be

He doesn't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around.
and over time, they'll turn into self-driving cars.
And so we gave them two hours of training,
you multiply that by the 120 million workers we have,
right there, and that blue box is that cyclist.
So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change
we're probably not going to see the wins we really need.
And then finally, there's how the system can handle uncertainty.
And then, there are those of us who don't have the privilege
sometimes on the road, like this guy pulling out between two self-driving cars.
we put them in the car, we let them use it,
So in 1885, Karl Benz invented the automobile.
All the time he's been doing 65 miles per hour down the freeway.
so it becomes quite a complicated problem.
When we're out on the road, other people have expectations:
and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car
Sure enough, the phone is charging.
And all of this has a very human cost.
I don't know what they're about to do,
In contrast, a self-driving system is probably making decisions
Now, my favorite story is this gentleman
And similarly, here, a cyclist blowing through that light as well.
In the time I have given this talk today,
but we really need to know what everybody's thinking,
is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't.
Watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us.
but first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem.
So it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be.
That's like comparing how fast I run
and then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment.
They can save a lot of lives in the interim,
1.2 million people are killed on the world's roads every year.
but to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like Steve get around,
means that it's not just a car, it's actually a police officer.
and what we heard back was something awesome,
Then we know where the car is in the moment,
Here somebody makes a right turn,
So let's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing.
We tested it a lot, but it could still fail.
In America alone, 33,000 people are killed each year.
that turns out to be about six billion minutes
our vehicles were driving through Mountain View,
that's about 1,000 times per mile.
We should do something about that.
that they're going to nudge out and around the car to the right.
and if you squint, you can see that in the imagery.
so it needs to get out of the way.
Similarly, the orange box on the side here,
pulls out his laptop,
that the driver assistance systems aren't going to be incredibly valuable.
to fix that bug, the driver.
Later that year, he took it out for the first public test drive,
Here we're dealing with a cyclist
We grew by six percent of roads,
Every one of them told us they loved it.
because if you're driving around town, and the car starts stopping randomly,
Once we started driving on neighborhood and city streets,
the less reliable the driver is going to get.
Here, as we make a lane change, the car to our left decides
and if you're really good at looking at laser data, you can see
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn that laser data and look at it,
so what trajectory it should follow, how quickly it should slow down or speed up.
that self-driving systems are different than driver assistance systems.
Thanks so much, Chris. CU: Thank you. (Applause)
Here there's a cyclist coming down the road
We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two.
about 10 times per second,
because you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless
The first, most crude model of this
and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like
It's really just two numbers at the end of the day.
and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does,
So there's a pretty big gap there.
It doesn't apply the brakes for you, it doesn't do anything goofy,
as someone trying to bring a product into the world.
we're going to put some package of technology on there,
we need a technology curve that looks like this.
and move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots,
and that means instead of a 30-minute drive to work in the morning,
My oldest son is 11, and that means in four and a half years,
between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems
I mean, there's a real debate going on out there right now.
so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack,
So if you take the average commute time in America, which is about 50 minutes,
So that's enough about the differences between the two.
So this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road, might not be.
So we're looking at this graph, and along the bottom
and we know they're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road.
and we have to treat that differently as well.
but really, this is what driving's like.
Now, if we look at the bottom left corner here,
we had the first test of a self-driving car
But if we want a self-driving car,
rather than driver assistance approach

the vehicle miles traveled increased by 38 percent.
he's going to be able to get his driver's license.
but he just happens to be blind,
but our vehicles were able to encounter that,
this is what our system looked like.
when it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident.
and it's really hard to move up to that new curve.
puts it on the seat,
and that's this curve, and it's going to have some operating properties,
but it also doesn't get you out of an accident.
if it presses the brakes unexpectedly, that's completely unacceptable.
It has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well.
But let's look at it from a different direction for a moment.
My team and I are committed to making sure that doesn't happen.
and that comes from the laser data.
I'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car
Unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention.
Chris Anderson: Chris, I've got a question for you.
and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person,
and in the last decade, we've actually started trying to make the car smarter
of how we expect them to move through the world.
So this is our vehicle.
Now, that's a big number, so let's put it in perspective.
to have the opportunity to change our cities
goes in the back again,
but in the case of a driver assistance system,
It's really a geometric understanding of the world.
And when a police officer stood in the road,
you're never going to buy that car.
futzes around, puts it into the laptop, puts it on the phone.
And that's not actually really easy to understand,
everyone else should have it, because people are terrible drivers."
Well, it's hard to say because it's a really complicated problem,
wasted in commuting every day.
that's the same as a 737 falling out of the sky every working day.
and up in the distance, if you look really closely,
Well, almost regular -- they were 100 Googlers,
You have to ask, "What are you thinking?"
driving down the highway.
To put that in perspective,
It's kind of unbelievable.
but we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen.
where we let regular people use it.
And then once you have that problem solved,
And then, even more importantly, we could take from that a model
and -- true story -- crashed into a wall.
but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing,
it's about 10 to the eighth, right?
There are now 17,000 less people dying every year in America.
is when one vehicle sees a construction zone,
going every which way,
So here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right,
slow down, and drive safely.
Back when we started in 2009,
so it's not in your brains.
it's a two-hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit
of sitting in traffic.
this technology is going to come to market.
On this debate between driver-assisted and fully driverless --
And of course, the vehicle responds safely.
to really get to the end case in safety,
We actually need to do something a little different.
you can see some cones.
Eight orders of magnitude.
Right? It's not sunny, it's rainy,
Let's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world.
the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction.
by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two,
Now as our light is red,
just getting from A to B.
to avoid some of the difficulty.
this is your classic car.
And of course, if anyone's breaking the rules, the police are there
that if I work really hard at jumping, one day I'll be able to fly.
having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane
and we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them,
make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents
So we thought about this and we said, it's kind of obvious, right?
Let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here.
and that's amazing, right?
Traffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago.
So if you compare the distance between these two,
but not just construction in isolation, of course.
And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives.
he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment.
And here, we watch a car blow through a red light
They started to pull forward, and fortunately for everyone,
slow down, take a better look, and then react appropriately after that.
But we actually have a much deeper understanding of this.
You see pedestrians crossing in front of us, cars crossing in front of us,
and actually having fully self-driving cars
34 people have died on America's roads.
This is a woman in an electric wheelchair
and what they can do for the world.
turning the steering wheel left or right, pressing the brake or gas.
And I'm going to start with some of our own experience.
And then that all turns into just following a path:
but of course, you encounter lots of things that you haven't
and in a moment here, somebody's going to make a U-turn in front of us,
and makes it through the intersection.
are going the driver-assisted route.
And of course, we have to deal with drivers,
it wants to as well.
But unlike a real self-driving car, this one had a big asterisk with it:
The better the technology gets,
and climb into the back, and something ugly will happen.
and other pedestrians should look like.
Here the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate
We're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle,
so I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly.
And the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes
but they weren't working on the project.
I can't tell, nor can any of our algorithms,
we've been working around that least reliable part of the car, the driver.
So how hard can it really be?
the hundreds of thousands of pedestrians, cyclists,
that we'll just take these driver assistance systems
even the very small ones.
that turns out to be 162 lifetimes
Now, if we want to bring a driver assistance system into a car,
Right? Unbelievable.
to make a lane change.
because the road in front of it is closed,
Cars are sold to us like this,
And now, watch the left as the car with the green box decides
So here, all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road,
and you want to do anything other than drive.
so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have.
about once every 100,000 miles in America.
Now, I just fire-hosed you with a lot of stuff there,
How soon can we bring it out?
and we'll pick some operating point up here
It doesn't matter how hard I train, I'm never actually going to get there.
And it's a big problem:
It starts by understanding where it is in the world,
this cyclists reacts, avoids,
digs around, pulls out the charging cable for his phone,
the cyclist's light has turned yellow already,
at some point, and then a driver is going to say, "This feels safe,"
Now, the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles.
So you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road,
that means it can't take action, because again,
CA: We will be tracking your progress with huge interest.
Now it turns out, there is nowhere in the DMV handbook
CA: So certainly, the mind of your cars is pretty mind-boggling.
because it doesn't have that capability.
Now, today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference
He's an incredibly capable guy,
But at the end of it, he said, "Not only should I have it,
"This is completely stupid. What are we thinking?"
And then given that, we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment,
But the cyclist, we see, is going to proceed through the intersection.
and understand what they look like
And so I'm going to talk to you about three different ways
because the urgency is so large.
But we'll pick some place along the curve here,
spent every day, wasted,
And of course, we have people who do I don't know what
Watch this bird fly across in front of us. The car reacts to that.
CU: Right. No, that's exactly right, and it's not to say
the problem becomes a whole new level of difficulty.
So what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again,
You take that six billion minutes
In fact, we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day,
but these are my two boys.
Now, we don't have to deal with just ducks.
Well, I'm here to tell you that's like me saying
and this was eye-opening.
because this was an experimental vehicle.
What you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end
and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist,
And so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system.
So here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us.
The car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are.

And, aside from the radically increased production
Now, it's interesting
although very scary at the time,
A company I'm engaged with has found
So I hate to put a timeline
How do we ensure that your body makes
they provide full protection from infection.
For the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans --
Well, we first figured out
We really could think of flu, then,
within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.
that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial
at which three strains are going to prevail the next year,
has never been done before in vaccine research.
but it's been 10 years every 10 years.
So the real question then is:
in the best of our monkey models,
Now think of where this leads us.
SB: No, malaria, there is a candidate
we have to make a best guess
from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate,
of flu vaccine for the three strains,
SB: You know, everybody says it's 10 years,
If you take these and you put them
Memory B cells turn into plasma cells,
Now, in the 27 years since HIV
if we can figure out how to deliver them.
for which humans have no natural immunity.
with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.
CA: And malaria's even further behind?
It's also why in the spring,
about 350 million doses
CA: In your gut, do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years?
as just a really bad cold,
we had surprising but exciting findings
and ensure healthy productive lives.
makes the job that much harder.
but not at all for HIV,
to make a preventive flu vaccine.
Or polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?
in a few isolated cases
for malaria, TB, HIV,
So right now, the world can produce
So, the challenge is full speed ahead.
The antibodies you just saw in this video,
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Now, you might think of flu
enough vaccine for everyone at low cost
the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.
on how an effective HIV vaccine might work.
and sinks all of them
and no longer is with us?
But with new or better vaccines
I know where to get them.
some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.
So today, we get our flu vaccines from ...
These memory cells immediately deploy
and with these tools we can produce
like war, terrorism,
Finding a weapon that recognizes
So if this works in humans, what we're talking about
In the longer term, what they can do
for everyone in the entire world
but, going back to what Michael Specter said,
and what's interesting is there already is
and some died within hours of developing symptoms.
and that is a severe flu pandemic.
each one is just slightly different.
although you might get a mild case.
Because these technologies are so efficient
This worked well for most pathogens,
we had an H5N1 virus
our supply of flu and made more available,
billions of chicken pellets
then we have the vaccine,
It spread like wildfire
we live in an era of breathtaking
at close to 100 percent,
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine,
there are millions of these ships;
we see these vaccines in use.
and you saw what happened.
for the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks,
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox,
your immune system to make these matching antibodies.
That's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out
So, Dan [Barber], if you want
So, if we can figure out how to do that,
and they may be the first place
an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat
and so we could produce enough swine origin flu
So, you've got this situation:
what we hope is we can prompt
When these mutate, they change their shape,
and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.
And with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.
Thank you very much.
Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine
So if we have the political and financial foresight
making experimental flu vaccines,
it's like making yogurt --
present that through a vaccine,
we get the body to really hate those socks.
that would infect the poultry flocks,
we just need a better one.
In 1918, a new virus appeared
from the blood of an HIV infected individual.
and we can make it happen.
because they thought the science was so difficult
Do you worry about what is going to kill you?
you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.
you could cripple all versions of the flu.
India, Mexico and others are already
to have a small, circular scar on our arms
carry all known strains
You could see an avian strain
we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans;
By that time, the battle against HIV
What the world needs now are these new vaccines,
In June, the World Health Organization
And by doing that, what it actually does is locking itself in place.
Now -- (Laughter) --
being two millimeters thin, quite thin.
So, a superconductor is defined by two properties.
This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand.
The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment
We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.
So, we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet.
But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking?
And these electrons, while flowing,
it just stays locked in midair.
I have here a superconductor, which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough.
However, inside a superconductor there are no collisions,
in which the magnetic field is the same all around,
and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.
and hopefully, if I did it correctly,
Why? Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics.
But how many fluxons, how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this?
And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect.
So what it actually does, it locks these strands,
It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong.
it was discovered 100 years ago.
Why? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place,
will change their configuration.
And I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.
You see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.
But what is electrical resistance?
three-inch diameter, with a single difference.
And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles.
You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation.
but they behave like particles.
Now, under proper conditions, which we have here,
and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.
So, this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.
I will try to rotate the track,
And when I place it on top of a regular magnet,
And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor,
Now, now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking,
Yeah, we understand that.
The first is zero electrical resistance,
And again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate,
Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter,
is called quantum levitation and quantum locking.
And we could also produce power cables, to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations.
these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor.
is exactly a superconductor.
which breaks the superconductivity state.
Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable.
One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk.
I can rearrange the fluxons, and it will be locked in this new configuration.
Like this, or move it slightly to the right or to the left.
Of course, I can turn it upside down,
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.
is called a superconductor.
so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields,
So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside,
and while it stays here -- don't move --
But that's not all, because superconductors don't like magnetic fields.
And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.
Now, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion.
But not here, because it is a quantum effect.
and make whatever track I want.
That sounds complicated, right?
they come in discrete quantities.
they collide with the atoms, and in these collisions
Now, I can extend this circular magnet,
And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail,
But the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know,
Now, it's quite an old phenomenon;
Now, while I'll let it circulate for a little more,
and it freely moves in this new position.
quantum levitation and quantum locking.
In classical physics, there is always some friction, some energy loss.
but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around,
However, only recently,
So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.
so there is no energy dissipation.
This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles,
and it will remain locked.
such as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators and so on.
Well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside,
because their movements dissipate energy,
which are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place.
let me tell you a little bit about superconductors.
Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand,
the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance --
because we have no dissipation.
So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works.
So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors,
Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.
In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.
You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet,
due to several technological advancements,
But we can also store energy using superconductors,
The superconducting layer, instead of being half a micron thin,
Well, we can calculate it, and it turns out, quite a lot.
is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin.
It's quite remarkable. Think about it.
they lose a certain amount of energy.
But that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something I haven't told you yet.
So, electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material.
and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor.
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?
And, yeah, the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here
the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.
Now, the combination of both effects --
And the object that was levitating here
I can take this disk and put it here,
For example, I can make a large circular rail here.
and it has the means to do that by circulating currents.

I know what a computer is:
