Better really hurry up.
That's a cool name. I will say that.
You gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments.
Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care.
There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.
I mean kids are studying this stuff

So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh
And this is all done, by the way,
I started working on this.
"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?"
Everybody goes, I'm happy.
You see the icosahedron again.
Before the horse. (Laughter)
"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not."
There we see Mars, again with various names.
As you can see, these are all maps.
These are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names.
But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity.
And that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago
And for me, that's a win-win.

is that something very interesting
it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
we can go from the digital world,
but the reason I'm showing you this
So we actually started with a number of volunteers
and the Obama campaign showed us this --
with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.
It's both 3D scanning in real time

was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,
and see from many, many directions.
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.
Or in regular, but in three dimensions,
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions
and making that accessible through the Internet.
it will open up to let you in.
You see on the left the pixels,
it's still somewhere on the planet.
where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,
The following day, again everybody went to the center
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.
were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.
that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,
almost as a cloud that can move in space.
And those particles are water,
You saw the big peak.
There's no doors or windows,
that if we see every day
to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.
is a cloud made of particles.
But we know very little about where things go.
of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."
Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.
they're starting to respond in a different way
in the same way as the real cloud
in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
of using water in public space, in architecture.
a regular configuration in two dimensions.
And, as computers in open air,
(Video) (Crowd Noise)
and actually captured his movement in 3D
Let's starting with sensing.
They're becoming like computers in open air.
something that monitors the car in real time,
and you had to jump without getting wet.
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs
and La Scala in Milan --
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.
about where our objects come from.
and the whole architecture will disappear,

We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --

the following project I'll show you now.
Well today, we know everything
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.
Or you could close the building,
one of today's top ballet dancers --
It started with a question by the mayor of the city,
there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
You can enter inside it.
Here are the results we just obtained.
And this is what led us to think about
how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.
but about things we use and consume.
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,
First overtime, second.
and play with color and movement
We've been working with Roberto Bolle,
our environment is starting to talk back to us.
With this information we realized
like London's new mountaintop.
and then started following it.
think about climate change or CO2 emissions --
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.
it's not about people,
Second half. End of normal time.
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,
Well today, for the first time,
in different scales or sizes,

Another quick example about sensing:
in doing something and changing our environment --
"Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?"
Imagine your screen could just appear
all of this sensing and actuating
is that real time control systems
Then we put a little chip, little tag,
Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
You can play with a different type.
What is interesting today
things they would throw away anyway.
in a way that we couldn't have done
But actually that night, it was even more fun.
And the idea here is, imagine, again,
You can go all the way through.
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.
but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,
a sensing and an actuating component.
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today
It's called The Cloud.
The roof also is covered with water.
and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.
The match begins -- silence.
in order to understand
at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --
he could tell you much more about sensing
up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
to tag what they were throwing away --
But then reality's always unpredictable.
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.
making calls and moving.
that's collected anyway by the operator,
When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,
for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,
you would call a real time control system.
just over a year ago,
where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,
testing the sensors that open the water.
people here and there,
and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.
So that was the reason for the project.
So imagine one helicopter,
sharing the main moments
This is what, in engineering terms,
who helped us in Seattle,
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,
And here was myself trying not to get wet,
that's a cellphone network --
control and going down to form the regular grid as before.
then we can also promote some behavioral change.
not the pixels' position.
but they are 50 percent of the world's population.
You can actually see from underneath,
as information is collected.
because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,
And then everybody moved down.
You see the timeline on the top.
that had been deployed all across the world --
solenoid valves, taps,
Here is the real Flyfire
And if we show that to people,
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.
and changing things in real time
And that was, for us, was very interesting,
and the prime minister at the time.
It's morning, before the match.
was actually use a new type of network at the time
cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,
to track trash as it moves through the system.
Here's the building working.
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,
we actually developed some small tags
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,
the architecture almost disappears.
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop
that you can approach and move through it
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.
Let me tell you a bit about it.
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,
You see the Colosseum in the middle,
just a 3D cloud of pixels
transmitting this information into the system,
we went from the physical world to the digital one.
Here you see the city.
And here you can see Roberto dancing.
is actually one of the first projects by our lab.
And the question was: How could technology, new technology,
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there
and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --
collecting information from the car,
is that, over the past couple of decades,
happening on the network.
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you
is starting to talk back to us.
that move in the air,
has a few thousand sensors
all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
that has happened over the past couple of years
Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.
just by monitoring activity
The whole building is made of water.
Well our objects, our environment
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.
Imagine you could have small helicopters
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,
This is a map that shows you
And I think what is remarkable
Now look at what happened that day
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.
that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition
It's called "Talk to Me."
This data was not available before.
but most importantly,
in doing this thing together, collectively.
at the entrance of the expo.
again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.
who came to us saying
at MoMA later this year, during the summer.
So the idea that we can actually involve people
actually you need also something like this --
but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.
and gravity and rotation.
And anyway, Italy won at the end.
And we got a commission to design a building
And I'll show just a few examples --
Paola Antonelli is organizing
Now today, if you want to win the race,
like barn raising, but with a cloud.
and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.
He liked it very much.
different types of resolution.
Our cities, over the past few years,
almost to impart what we call cloud raising --
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.
is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
is entering our everyday objects.
and then projections on them.
because the way of engaging with the building became something different.
if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.
as you see in this image.
I want to show you something here for the first time.
So you can have this cloud.
and something you can go to the top [of],
with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,
in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --
on a good driver and a good car.
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.
from people's movement, or so and so.
and that's actuating our environment.
Here is an image then of the building
But tomorrow it can be,
you take a budget, and you bet your budget
And even you can approach it, and it will open up
So both the physical cloud in the sky
that are used and interact with people.
That means something built in a city.
if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,
France scores. Italy scores.
you can show patterns, images, text.
actually you can still see a small chip underneath --
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.
different types of things, as you can see here --
And that's the beauty of doing things
we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.
when all of the sensors stopped working.
you can write on it,
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.
and really using it as a way to connect with the community.
And basically, it's a system made of two components --
This can be, in our case,
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night
over the past couple of decades.
to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.
I've got something to show you.
If those pixels fall,
like the one we saw before,
to the physical one.

I'd like to start tonight by something completely different,
we're going to head to the high seas.
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.
this is where they get their common name.
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.
and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,
65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,
fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,
So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.
The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,
a real three-dimensional play.
and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes --
but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?
and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage
But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,
and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here
that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs --
and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have --
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,
kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,
rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,
and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean --
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.
but also, most recently, with climate change,
And in terms of fishes --
during the course that the tag is recording.
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,
for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.
And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.
and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.
So it may be good for the waistline,

And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know
that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.
They're not big migrators. This is their track:
and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,
that population doesn't get replenished.
And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch --

Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense
So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,

and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.
because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,
then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators --

they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up
but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi
and then you look at the sunfish.
So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.
you can see they strike this funny little position that says,

they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,

And they come and give the Molas --
Well, not the one we tagged!
and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.
They just lay out on the surface of the sea
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
Well, there's some great new technology
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.
and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction --
We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.
And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we --
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared --

Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,

If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,
which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.
so we head down south, to San Diego.
And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,
that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish --
they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,
they make up up to 90 percent.
we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.
we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?
And it's a lively and a lovely place,
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is

I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.
and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.

What is most important is we do it

Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his

So I can go back to my story.
So I thought that that's actually my problem.

If you take the camera above, you start thinking
And in that way you organize the financing
Once you have more than 10 of them
And those can be environmental bonds.
You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,
the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke --
you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.
The second angle, like in this clip.
and they sit down and click.
but what was really painful for me was,
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.
something new needs to be invented.
So they're deprived of understanding their reality.
Put all of those bonds at one place
which was, you know, survival below one side,
and depending on time I may give you two examples
We finance anything that a media company would need,
with people who represent different foundations.

In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.
The governor says, "We will close you."
you can make it easy for investors.
First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.
as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.
Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.
And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about
We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."
At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem,
there's nothing stopping the next organization
a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice,
because they're all kind of heroes.
Imagine that this third of this room is filled
Because I thought, I still maintain,
You can, once you have all of those different points,
And there are different ways.
Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.

Somebody must have started something like that.

You know, instead of people running in this dark,

I have no interest in being in media business.
But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.

where government really wants to make your life miserable.
And basically what I was saying is very simple.
It's so obvious, straight in your face,
You know, you find somebody who is respectable
So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.
But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them,
Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags,

But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand
It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way
So it sounds like a great story.
Now take it to the last step.
because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes
who is going to succeed me.
See that it will not work.
I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.
It's actually just a drop in the sea.

I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's,
independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment,
Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet

and if you are a banker for independent media.
Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.
But let's take the idea further.
you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come --
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed
of nonprofits doing spectacular work.
We were the best that they could do.
this last session we had about Africa and his
there are elections coming up in nine months.
because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.
And that's the best they could do.
But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.
Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.
because I have elections --
The city was closed until early '90s

So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:
We had the ability to understand what was going on.
for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.
But what is most important here is, who do we finance?
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself
Now ours is just one story.
But however you put it, you know, the numbers
So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.
can be actually financed in this way.
Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running
That was really the only question he had.
which means they should help you.
So here's the daily newspaper
At that time I was running B92, the only independent,
average interest rate five percent to six percent.
And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time
So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,

The government cutting them off
electricity in Bangladesh bonds.
I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.
Now imagine that every second person over here
running around to find each other.
And what did I know at that time about media systems?
First independent newspaper in Slovakia.
What do investors get?
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,
If there are investors willing to finance
is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music
Over these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing,
So from that perspective, what we did is just really
So I thought that it will be good to start with it.
40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries.
so there are no dark rooms, no blind people
Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich
But what they really do, which is very powerful,
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.
And it's why it was invented.
once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.
Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.
And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,
He was running a media systems organization
So here we are having our first client, brilliant.
Six months later the newspaper was closed.
He goes and sees the governor. The governor says,
so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.
It's business anywhere.
But that's totally another and separate topic.
you could not just Google in '91.
from printing presses to transmitters.
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,
Just quickly on the results.
it's why independent media is in business.
the power of, and importance of, independent media
And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company
Boris Nikolayevich says, "No, you cannot do it."
actually invites him to come to his office.
You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time;
does something with it.
Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,
And we said, that's fine; let's meet;
But there is a second angle to that.
where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.
So I thought, why don't we get into that business?
Governor comes to him one day,
to start to issue bonds next spring.
a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control,
What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.
Instead of all of that we thought there is --
What do we typically finance?
that serious and independent media companies are great business.
is to get a printing press.
a marketplace for all of that,
You collect interest and do nothing in between.
And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,
who has the same goals.
And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.
who either twists that information, or colors that information,
on one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.
They want to -- the only way for them to survive
I knew two things after that meeting.
Yeah, it was the usual cocktail:
but they can also lose press freedom,
by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business
government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,
Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?
They come to us with a request for a loan.
So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.
How much would that cost?
the most respected newspaper in that small place.
You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.
and somebody must have thought of it.
The information they get gets filtered through somebody
and has a lot of money.
He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.
After two years working with us, he becomes
And I could spend hours talking about them,
of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult

that is providing loans to media companies.
I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation
so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
And here is the most stunning number.
Here is where the problem is,
It's not a bank. We had to actually

they have no latest news; circulation goes down.
I will not run, but it's very important for me

You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.
because I thought there must be an institution in the world
So that is how we understood what our method is.
Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.
The small one was, I just wanted him
That means that they have no sports;
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later;
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here;
We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them,
but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.
We believe that in the last 10 years companies
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world.
the small one and the big one.
We were actually recording history.
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only
I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories
some of the issues that we were talking about last night --
lives in the societies without independent press.
To make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office,
It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.
Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually,
look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;
trying for the third time to convince him that
from this side of the room
that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.
Because when you think about the importance,
So what the governor got was an empty shell.
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,
you know, they threaten your advertisers.
At the end of the meeting he says,
why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance

Culture is an organic term, isn't it?
and with organic systems, if the conditions are right,

What schools are encouraged to do is to find out

Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools.
They have a very broad approach to education,
Small people wandering about.
That's what happens in some systems.
You see, there's a big difference here
and the people who do it are the teachers and the students,

We are after all organic creatures,

generally at a predefined place.
Try and find these balloons fastest, and the winner will get $40,000."
You should get points for doing this on time.
And this is so powerful that, when they tweak their stats,
players have to do something at a predefined time,
And this is so deep-seated in our psyche
So, the social layer is all about these connections.
and said, "Use networks.
This is one that isn't a game yet, but really should be.
And so I say that I want to build a game layer on top of the world,
And this is a dynamic in which to succeed,
and that bothers me.
and makes it, you know, productive down the road.
and do all sorts of cool things to remind you to take your medicine.
and construction on that layer is over, it's finished.
is decided upon, and that's really important.
is something called happy hour.
Their most dedicated players, it's like a full-time job.
It's called the appointment dynamic.
and the framework in which that is constructed,
six, six-and-a-half hours a day on it.
So the first one, it's a very simple game dynamic.
Let's all build it together, let's do it well and have fun playing.
They had a leader board, where, if you recommended the best stories,
The average player spends something like
It is very powerful. It is very exciting.
what we've seen has been building the social layer,
And they made this into a game, initially.
Farmville has more active users than Twitter.
This is used all over the place, including LinkedIn,
There are statuses. I mean, what is valedictorian, but a status?
We can influence behavior.
But this next decade -- and that's a real thing.
And now they're just looking for a little sticker that says "Boardwalk."
The reason that it's so important is that, the last decade,
the most interesting stories.
You won't do anything else with the rest of your day.
because I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this, still.
We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare.
to try and find Boardwalk, right.
If you haven't, I recommend playing it.
more of a what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen,
And so today, I'm going to show you four,
while the frameworks like Facebook, like the Open Graph,
This next decade is the decade of games.
not CVS -- at Christian Dior or something, and then ...
but the sort of cottage industries that form
Digg is a communal dynamic
They're not very well designed, right?
I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now.
you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen,
I think everything is a game, but this is sort of
that at this moment, while it's just getting constructed,
is a game, it's just not a terribly well-designed game, right.
last decade was the decade of social.
And you see someone at CVS or --
where the game is not the Monopoly game you're playing,
I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world,
like Digg, which I'm sure you've all heard of.
It also exists in more conventional game forms.
by doing challenges, by engaging with the business,
And so it's incredibly critical
so I think I'm qualified to talk on school --
so if I'm going to leave you with anything,
the framework has been decided; it is the Open Graph API.
It's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly,
where, by going to the same place over and over,
It can be used in interesting ways.
and perhaps more invisibly.
And so when you want to build on the social layer,
We all want that credit card on the far left
So we have to use this one carefully.
And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it,
and if you were going to fight, you know, orcs on the fields of Mordor
So with that, you know, a couple game dynamics to talk about.
And it's very powerful.
It's going to affect our lives more deeply
They own half a billion people.
It's used in your wallets, right now.
and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now.
and coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes
They go places, they do challenges, they earn points.
one that shows how this is already being used in the real world,
and that's a paladin level 20,
and you level up from B to an A.
and can be used more consciously in conventional settings.
and they own all of our connections.
It's used all over the place.
in which that framework will get built,
the network that is society
that it doesn't just influence our behavior, it's influenced our entire culture.
so with each dynamic, I'm going to give three examples:
I mean, you see this is a paladin level 10,
where they have quizzes where you gain experience points,
It's also used in more conventional settings
They've created this thing called the Open Graph,
So this is one of the most famous game dynamics.
So if they wanted the world to end, if they wanted productivity to stop,
And communal discovery is powerful because it leverages
This game dynamic is so powerful
This is used in conventional games as well.
two-dimensional swath of land that we have.
And at Princeton, they've actually experimented with this,
I like it quite a lot.
Influence and status.
to achieve something.
Easy wins. I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here.
This sort of loss of free will that occurs in games
And the resources that we use are not this
That sucks. Why not level-up?
We're going to jump onto the next one, maybe. Yes.
both for good, for bad, for in-between.
To win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.
is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses,
Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?
It's actually about using dynamics, using forces,
and that means that I am somehow better than everyone else.
got $2,000 and anyone else to push that recommendation up
Come here at a certain time, get your drinks half off.
One of the things that we work on at SCVNGR
where I actually grew up.
everywhere you are and everywhere you go.
because they've got that cool red badge thing,
where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon
and it's called Facebook.
It looks like the Web did back in 1997, right?
And this is simply an appointment dynamic.
Also proud to have relocated here to Boston,
to take to try and complete that progress bar, we will do it.
So like I said, the way that you go through and build on the game layer
and connecting you to other people
where they created sort of a pyramid scheme, a network,
And that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful.
but the framework itself is done,
who would work together to make sure they maintained that position.
after eight hours, or after six hours, or after 24 hours,
The final one I want to talk about -- and it's a great one to end on --
And it looks like this right now.
I am a proud Princeton dropout.
and presented with easy, granular steps
for anything that we want.
It's not about adding a social fabric to the Web
And the winner was actually a group out of MIT,
and how do we leverage this and how do we use this,
four really important game dynamics, really interesting things,
when they say your crops wilt
and can be used in the real world.
because it's already under construction; it's already happening.
that when we're presented with a progress bar
the better we'll be able to use it
So school is a game, and there have been lots of experimentations
The game layer is all about influence.
"Modern Warfare," one of the most successful selling games of all time.
There's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social
And so, sort of, the crux of this presentation is going to go through
These progression dynamics are powerful
but that's not quite true
and the more consciously we can think about this,
And this is used in games as well.
There's still a lot to explore.
But it became so powerful that there was actually a cabal,
are game dynamics themselves.
and fun and engagement to businesses.
So I just recently dropped out of Princeton
It's insane. And they have these systems where you can level-up.
because construction has just begun,
And that really motivated people to find the best stories.
to water your crops -- fake crops -- or they wilt.
and is able to drive meaningful revenue
And so that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics,
I think people would probably work a lot harder.
I want that because that means that they're cooler than I am,
where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States
you would get points.
And the tools, the resources
where you have to return at a certain time
creates huge loyalty, creates engagement,
I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,
that is available, and that can be leveraged for good.
in a way that makes it acceptable
So they whip it out. And you see men, they have that black card.
This is the DARPA balloon challenge,
has been this framework for connections,
And they have these GlowCaps, which, you know, flash and email you
"We can do better. We can build this better."
It's incredibly powerful, and it has this dynamic
pulls them back to the same local businesses,
So the first one -- the most famous appointment dynamic in the world --
where I am an un-whole individual.
and that we do it in a way that is open,
If we called valedictorian a "white knight paladin level 20,"
I mean, we want to build frameworks
But it can also be used to find real things.
It's something that people don't do very well.
Bob the Builder, says,
that it hooks people into these dynamics,
where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior,
so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful.
that we think about it very consciously,
That's an appointment.
But luckily, as my favorite action hero,
And this is powerful enough that we can see
the game framework is built,
and then one how this can be used for good,
"World of Warcraft" is one of the most successful games of all time.
are being created for the game layer equivalent,
I don't know. I don't have a black card; I've got a debit card.
to help people take their medicine on time.
So, that's unfortunate.
and you eventually unlock rewards.
And so people work very hard to level-up.
you have to move through different steps in a very granular fashion.
There are levels. There are C. There are B. There is A.
If you're not, too bad. There's nothing you can do.
and that it's very important that we build it properly.
This is a local company called Vitality, and they've created a product
in which we connect with other people was built,
where you have to sort of make progress,
And if you're happy with that, fantastic.
But this could also be used for good.
and the decade of where the framework
you'd probably want to be the bigger one, right.
that with seven game dynamics, you can get anyone to do anything.
The third one I want to talk about quickly is the progression dynamic,
and actually are building the game layer: they just suck.
was the decade of social
one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game --

then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.
and what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.

is to show them their own spending,
Just consider this one fact:
we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds
This, I think, is a huge change.
but now with the huge advances in information technology,

That's the argument I want to make tonight.

Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost
So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level,

and you were scanning two people talking to each other
That means that the brains are synced up
So they had people play this game

It's good for them. They make a lot of money.
An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody

So here's how game theorists look at these data.
Right? Who thinks you could beat the chimps?

and ugly divorces and things like that.
He had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis.
In this case, the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction,
which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation
in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal.
And notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there.
to be part of what's called a "theory of mind" circuit,
"We're probably not going to make a deal here."
Your intuition might tell you that too.

That's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining,

One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp, interesting answer.
which is that they should match 50-50,
That is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.
"This person's going to be a good poker player,"
That is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity

Game theoretically, that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift,
There's another group of people who seem to have

Where are these things happening in the brain?
One chimp is called a matcher.
so we can ask about time-synced activity
like a seeker finding someone in hide-and-seek, or right, right.
and so I'm going to go to the right, make sure he doesn't get it.
and they have to press the squares
They're also very obsessed with status.
Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice
due largely to John Nash of "A Beautiful Mind" fame,
This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory.
They don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22.
The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers.
You don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits,
Some of the earliest ones were done in the '90s

in lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing "Simon Says,"
that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life

The reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too.
So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time,

Now it's four apple cubes,
A lot of people say, "I really don't know what people are going to pick,

which is something like strategic thinking during competition.
Just like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse
that are really, really important to them
So a point here is the behavior by a pair of players,
that there's very little to split: "I'm giving you the most that I can."
They're just choosing randomly.
because what happens is, the mismatcher will think,
Everyone chooses a number from zero to 100,

Okay, so the next part of this study

Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times.
by lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute.
So we know that those two-step players are doing something differently.
Now if you were to step back and say, "What can we do with this information?"
We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining

So it turns out that this dance has a great many variations
and all the insights of that moment.
Machine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players,
And here's kind of how it goes.
People on the left take difficult shots,
and they both move and stuff happens, and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll.
I'm going to show you that moment
So what we're doing is turning our athletes into --

whether a pick-and-roll happened or not.
and while it's not that special to be smarter than me,

but they do it under the basket, it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
Where are the defenders standing? What are their distances?
So if I'm standing near the basket
And the reason that's important is that there are lots of 47s out there.
So why is this important?
Because the first thing is, you have to make it sound hard --

Basically things only professionals know.
It would make our lives a lot easier, but it turns out movement is very messy.
Events like post-ups, and pick-and-rolls, and isolations.
So not only that, we have given advice that has changed strategies
Here are some pick-and-rolls, and here are some things that are not.
So if I was going to teach it the difference
The guy guarding the ball can either go over or under.
and I didn't know most of these things when I started
The problem is a machine can't see the game with the eye of a coach.
and learned more and more complex things
That's roughly how it happened.
The pick-and-roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players,
that have helped teams win very important games,
this pick-and-roll is perhaps the most important play.
You do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement.
we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail.

His teammate can either roll or pop.
we were wondering, can a machine know more than a coach?
[Calculating shot probability]
But we never knew how good "good" was, or how bad "bad" was quantitatively.
What will we know? What will we learn?
So what we can do, again, using spatiotemporal features,
and he kind of stays there
distance, timing, velocities --
Which could literally be happening any second now.
and the insights we have for every second of every NBA game -- it's not that.
And it's very exciting, it's much more than the pick-and-roll.
But there are things that, for example, basketball coaches want to know.
that's all you knew before.
it changes how we look at the game.
And knowing how to run it, and knowing how to defend it,

So what are these dots?

Can it know more than person could know?
is a good shooter who takes bad shots
Perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings, better plan our cities.
So here's a bubble chart, because what's TED without a bubble chart?
or a bad shooter who takes good shots.
it's hard to deal with and not that interesting.
and that's why we need this to be really, really good.
you probably guessed it --
it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
So we have taught a machine to see with the eyes of a coach.
And it turns out the answer is yes.
The size is the size of the player and the color is the position.
the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter.
Things that most casual fans would know.
And then we moved on to things slightly more complicated.
It's the fact you don't have to be a professional team to track movement.
Now, we've gotten to a point where today, the machine understands complex events
If I asked a coach to describe something like a pick-and-roll,
Or, if he does go close by and he does stop

And so it's really important to know

if the 47 that you're considering giving 100 million dollars to
I believe that with the development of the science of moving dots,

on the right, they take easy shots.
So how have we been able to do this?
what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances?
Or if he does stop, but he doesn't stop close enough,
[Rebound probability]
So, luckily, with machine learning, we can go beyond our own ability
The crowd goes wild.
It turns out in modern basketball,
On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.
So that is also an example of a terrible algorithm.
We can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts

it really disturbed the piece --
and my left leg also.
it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.
I had the question popped into my head:
and I'm very interested in that.
And then when I did the second one,
it's usually to solve a question.
of two events that are happening,
so you could see the one that was done before.
JH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?
sand, powders or anything like that.
if you could step outside and into a larger context,
that look like forms that we're familiar with
just by the marriage
But with the pendulum,
And then I left gaps
to be able to support that.
and bring it up to another level,
or is my eye making that interference pattern --
There are shapes that come about
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.
but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.
like how a magazine color is printed --
JH: Is that a literal part of the image,
It could be tomato sauce,
especially astronomical forms

You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.

I mean, I've got the symptoms.
I suppose it's an electromagnetic force

TS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit

The sun end was about four inches in diameter,

are in this state of confrontation
TS: So here are the --
that I really enjoy.
TS: Thank you, John.
I sort of think about it as the DNA --
and they're interference patterns.

so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces
It needs more red, it needs more blue,
in playing with these forces.
which describes how gravity works.
So that told me right away: I need a remote control device.
because I think the fields
I draw with a simple pencil,
there are these moires and interference patterns
of the universe, basically.
But the paintings become very complex,
and there are lines behind the one on the left,
and it's my way of just thinking.
TS: Yes, they're servos with cams
Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.
or crocodiles, elephants.

to very simple forms.

I try to refine them down
There are lines in front of the one on the right,

If I throw a very concentric circle,
JH: Well, I love the idea
I threw it into an orbit,
I'm left-handed, and so I draw.
you've got the fluid dynamics.
JH: Whoa. That is ...
these amazing things started appearing.
It's really manifested there.
It's a terrific studio assistant.
Like the occurrence of moire patterns.
JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.
You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,
and see these two things as an object,
TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.
JH: So many forces there.

Not necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?
SP: All right, let's get over to that site.
the two most popular mounts --
for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler --
So, I called back Major Heilshorn,
what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.
I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.
And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&amp;As,
Get your bag, get your bag!
I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean.
a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.
that then became my story, was --
They've got to die outside.
I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me,
with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.
as a way of bridging.
MM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil.
Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show --
ZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face.
And I knew what he was going to say.
I think when Major H told me,
I've lost all faith in the media --
To tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?
Right? And we started talking.
I'll share one story.
They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.
SP: We're here to create money.
that he would read that journal.
So when I talk about a disconnect,
This was a big thing that
I feel exploited and proud at the same time.
Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.
And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.

They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,
I was a biology major before I went into architecture,
and it's actually a four-story glass box.
And so you can imagine, even in this application, that
In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy,
When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds
to actual future application in architecture,
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials,
in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.
You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,

On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal

So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.
We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires
and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,
and that's a very big deal for architecture.
and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery
and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.

this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces
So I want to leave you with one last impression about

day after day, when you're on vacation

and so here you see a pretty typical
or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.
and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,
and with that came the irreversible reliance on

It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,

What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.
and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls
Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,
a thermo-bimetal pattern system
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,
in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know,

And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate

each of the tiles moves individually.
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now,
and so what I propose is that our building skins

out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy
to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,
and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little
because we can sheath the building with these things,
mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.
and differentiated, depending on where it is.
And so you see here some early studies of blocks,
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things
This last project is also of components.
and for some of you may understand the heat island effect

I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market,
It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,
and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,

The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior
than the adjacent rural areas,
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.
until that air conditioning system can start up again.
and in other areas, it's a ventilating system,
So this kind of proof of concept project

how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow
and the small windows were also very good because
but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,
out of this hole that we've dug?
as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.
it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine
And this gets me back to my research.
no controls and it requires no energy,
a common problem of overheating.
we can't open a window here, and so
hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
that work together very dynamically and very efficiently,
in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm
We blast the air conditioning the entire way,
It's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely
And you might remember, some of you,
we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore
when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,
smaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to,
and my father would not let us use the air conditioner.
In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.
very cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,
rolled steel and mass production, we were able
Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.
I basically had to roll down the window.
right now that are on the boards, where you can see,
and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.
And the bike route's going right through the building,
It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington,

And so I made a counter-proposal:
came, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later.
where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum
Just cut the whole museum through the mountain --
the kind of spaces that these galleries could be.
how to make it not capricious.
And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.
a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea,
Let's get back to the town and walk to the site."
Every wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building.
that a building the size of the Washington building --
And all the galleries,
they're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel --
there are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years.
it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.
I wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.
and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.
This voice does not repeat for six months.
has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization;
But two weeks later, I was in this little town, Anandpur Sahib,
very transparent and inviting and looking in.
Well, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose.
because we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy.
and then you come into a large space.
so I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean,"
"We Sikhs have suffered a great deal, as you have Jews.
spaces where research goes on, conference centers,
I have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917,
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings

And there were all kinds of exciting features:
who had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz,
And my proposal was to split the museum into two --
Thank you very much. (Applause)
and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry.
a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is --
I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term "beauty."
I was asked to do a building,
ages and place of birth of the children.
they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.
as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress.
it would make them just unable to digest.
on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.
And so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas,
and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that.
And the client was happy -- well, sort of happy
"We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here.
as he wrote the Khalsa, which is their holy scripture.
how to make it white, how to make it translucent, how to make it glowing,
I'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months.
and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs."
with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.
Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness
And again, I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion
which is a skylight on top of that triangle.
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs --
And I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch.
and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about --
and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information.
You cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high,
Beauty in the most profound sense of fit.
and you could walk through them or on the roof.
every beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood.
and we were working.
You see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall,
because you stop the design of that particular process.
There's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished
I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction;
This is actually a Spanish quarry, which sort of inspired
it would be an office building, a conference center,
Twenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together,
This used to be an island -- Ackerman Island --
which you see here the campus.
The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands --
The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces --
He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.
and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building.
and to see yet another museum with information,
and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles,
that its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function."
we shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty."
and the uniqueness of a program in a building.
totally rational: it's an instrument -- had something to do with science,
and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits,
and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying,
Unfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard
And here's the building as it opened,
And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me,
And so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously.
and ... the bridge was built!
And at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain,
you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall,
not something you feel you could just change
come back and pay the five dollars admission.
and at night, and on opening day.
If it were to be anywhere in Washington,
It was, what I would say, compositional complexity,
You walk through the space, a voice reads the names,
because now Washington was built -- the Holocaust Museum in Washington --
a reception building and some underground parking.
which demands maybe new materials:
The first image I showed the building committee was
The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building:
And so my first sketch after I left was to say,
that the last guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind, died in
and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown.
and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the Holocaust.
they sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island?
And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs
and of the Jerusalem hills.
And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island
they are totally saturated with information
I'd like you to come and design it."
Through nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man,
you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.
concrete walls, stone, the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts.
that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera --

in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,
He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?"
And I said, "This just doesn't make any sense.
He who seeks order shall find gratification.
How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person?
one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building
And they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years,
and you see the openings for the light.
the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.
We call a natural object beautiful because we see
I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem
And here you see the model:
And that was a lot of heat to deal with.
Studies for the structure of the roof,
but it seems to me that all this, in one way or the other, is a search for beauty.
And it took six months to reroute it.
And, as things are a little easier in India, the site was purchased within a week

peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced,
many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities,
descend through the rock into an underground chamber.
But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.
And I got all excited and came back, and
pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.
Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum
we don't want to turn our back to the community."
because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum,
they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."
The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial;
Arrogance is incompatible with nature.
that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place
And it seemed to me that this structure -- complex, rich and yet
These are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights,
to flood the valley into a series of water gardens
and that we will go into galleries -- rooms with doors
I'd like to conclude by saying something ...
And I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river, part of the river.
It was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity.
"Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."
we took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.
and said, "That's where we have chosen the location."
how do we discover what is really particular about a project?
And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground,
how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure;
and the temple and also next to it the fortress
And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building
that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment
some of it has to be on the mainland because
I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it
Well, they said, "People won't understand,
And I came back and, lo and behold, the little model I'd left behind

and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition,

If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof,
So, many years after that in 1998,
and changing exhibitions on the other --
And there are chambers carved in the rock --
And when there were complaints about budget, I said,
In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum
by an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions.
nine kilometers away from the town and the temple,
and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers.
it bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city
and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools,
that was very dear to Kahn's heart, which is:
And this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry,
We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people;
and this hill, and bridge all the way into the town.
But of course, the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter -- the Jews make it hard:
And out of this idea started spinning off many,
Every piece of the building works.
And half a million people gathered for the celebrations;
this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.
And this is where it is; it's sort of evolving.
"You can't put it all on an island;
And I felt very troubled.
and there was going to be groundbreaking.
And here studying, in three dimensions,
50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill
they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself,
Back to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began,
come out on the other side of the mountain --
"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.
so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building.
They said, "Let's rebuild the museum."
walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape.
outside Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab,
as you move through them and so on, are below grade.
on a site, right downtown by the river.
"Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building."
And finally the building -- this is the model.
And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there,
And then, coming towards the north, it opens up:
And I know it is not a fashionable term these days,
some kind of a generating geometry.
I was very moved by what I saw today.
And I recommended they do it right there, on that hill
And then I went away for four months
and extends right through as you go towards the north.
a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking --
because I talked about what makes a building a building of science.
I said, "No building." There was a cave on the site; we tunnel into the hill,
Within the working drawings!
And then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.
Nevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us
But I was still troubled, and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious.
There is a single candle flickering in the center;
He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem,
enter from one side of the mountain,
So, what I'd like to talk about is something
And so the process began and they said,
And then you descend to light and to the north and to life.

the permanent exhibits at one end, the auditorium, library,
That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.

So, people who think of evolution

I was talking to the oil industry recently

with changing, now, the evolutionary tree,
it was going from the analog world of biology

and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,
Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?
and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,
So, this may sound like genomic alchemy,

We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;
If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.
And for those of you who prefer miles per hour,
and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds
and it's a very destructive process.
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.
And again, we can see it in slightly different form there,
is that you have to molt. And every three months or so
which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time,

just like these pictures show.
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards --
that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.
And what that is, is cavitation.
because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter)
So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,
in order to generate the amount of force that we observe,
and I didn't know what that was.
And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.
I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.
this is serious business for me.

And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,
the collapse of the cavitation bubble.
Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.

and these guys open up snails for a living.
I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system

this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species --

And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas
And so this is just a regular video of the animal

their heel all the way to the flesh.
And I immediately came upon a problem.
And so I wired up what's called a load cell.
I have to do a little bit more background reading,
And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,
So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.
And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,
over the surface of this type of shape.
So, very interesting parallels between the biological

Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects

what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually
And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,
Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod,
what's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism."
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.
and does, in fact, function as a spring.
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving
And that's basically what's called a "power amplification system."
But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later,
which results in the water literally vaporizing.
So really, just an amazing image,
and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away
So these animals go into a molting period where they're
So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,
so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah.
And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike

that could capture these movements,

is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.
And the snail's wired to a stick,

it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.
And again, I think this will be a world record.
a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.
looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.
to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.
so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces
of extra material requirements for building it.
So, one question I often get after this talk --
going back to the molting phenomenon.
a few years ago because they make sound.
does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier.
People have been struggling for years to try and design
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:
So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.
and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.
it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.
And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use
And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's --
But that was not the end of the story.
making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots
it just came out about a year ago --
And we were in for our first surprise.
no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.
The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.
That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,
on the extreme animal movement spectrum.
and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.
So if you're going to build a thin gold structure,
well over 200 pounds of force.
right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.
that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,
and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do
I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.
not as a spring but as a visual signal.
the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.
And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,
because I could never have done this in a million years --
and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.
And I think one explanation for this could be
So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators,
well, how fast does this limb move?
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.
because it destroys boat propellers.
exploding upward to actually just catch
And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department,
by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.
well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,
He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.
And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show
one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot
I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking,
And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.
And we went back to those high-speed videos again,
So the next and final question was, well, how much force
when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,
And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,
and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.

So, we've had very solid evidence showing
It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.
moving at extremely different speeds.
the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.
So, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp
And so the first question that came to mind was,
to build this type of surface, and it's very strong.
up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating

but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be
that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.
right in the middle of their spring.
So, I'll play it one more time.
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology --
and we measured how fast the limb was moving
And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up --
It has curves in two directions,
to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.
And again, we were in for a surprise.
And that was what really got me puzzled.
and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.
In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point
But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.
the saddle could very well be a spring.
where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,
In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.
And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.
And actually, this work was done in the 1960s
whether it's a spearer or a smasher,
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.
has actually been well known to biologists for a long time,
And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.
You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,
And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.
That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.
And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell
Again, going back to those high-speed videos,
and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in.
It's a well-established fact of these animals
which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,
And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter)
And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,
So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.
which occurs when you have areas of water
Because obviously, if it's breaking snails,
So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.
because it requires very little material
We simply couldn't capture it on video.
extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.
that's 87 and a half feet spanwise.
And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring
because it's a very strong surface in compression.
And we were able to get some force measurements out.
and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.
of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.
there are spearers and smashers.
So we thought, OK, this must be a spring --
but not half a millisecond later.
and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.
And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,
So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second,
So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?
not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,
So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring --
And all of these are the same principles that apply
one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.

and a latch that prevents anything from moving.
suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.
And this is very well known to engineers and architects,
so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure
So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here,
that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.
And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation
This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period
played back at 15 frames per second.
So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,
And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built
And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change
on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.
So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further,
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.
just smashing the heck out of this load cell.
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon
And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins
So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties:
and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.
It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,
the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first
So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,
at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.
So that was really cool and very unexpected.
it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow.

So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold
I have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant.
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,
not just for American achievement in science and technology,
crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you.
and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island --
Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.
It's a very popular museum now,
But then I was very disappointed
My goal of the design is not when it's completed.
if that is made to make money.
In case you're finished with toilet paper,
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test
but collapse of the buildings kill people.
But over two million people cut trees.
And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China,
So I thought, even as architects,
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.
In the shelters built by the U.N.,
This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.
Look at this. Even civil government is doing
and also easy to demolish,
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.
And he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?
then cutting trees again.
with all the student volunteers with paper tubes,
Thank you very much. (Applause)
to complete the 35-meter-long office.
organized by the U.N.
and I met the society of Vietnamese people.
you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.
After the earthquake and tsunami,
Then I was very lucky to win the competition
by making monumental architecture.
1986, much, much longer before people started talking
So during the summer with my students,
Those are invisible.
I wanted to rent an office in Paris,
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests,
to build the second Pompidou Center in France
all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.
I used beer crates as a foundation.
and this exhibition is the first one I did
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.
But look at this. There's no privacy.
He said, "As long as you collect money by yourself,
Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake,

former Prime Minister Berlusconi
but it's impossible to fly over,
to drive six hours to get to Haiti
Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village
to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate,
For example, earthquakes never kill people,
you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter)
They have money and power.
Because I was so poor,
After a fire, what are you proposing?"
Because we were part of the exhibition,
I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.
Then people need some temporary housing,
so I thought, we have to make multi-story building
That's the responsibility of architects.
and in order to make it easy to be built by students
That was the problem.
I made a paper tube shelter for them,
1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.
And I'd like to keep building monuments
there are only 12 tubes with a diameter
so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country,
I was asked to design the building,
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society,
to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.
and the city like this Nagata district,
within the budget of the government
to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.
suffering and gathering at a Catholic church --
so we dismantled them,
to rebuild this temporary auditorium.
so I decided to bring my students to Paris
in the city of Metz.
There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters],
So he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.
2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.
In one month, we completed nine classrooms,
but I couldn't afford it,
I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall,
all the building was totally destroyed.
in order to use this as a building structure.
Nearly 7,000 people were killed,
and also especially many of the schools were destroyed
and our former prime minister came,
Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.
the symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.
because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.
So that is why I started working in disaster areas.
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose,
I used the shipping container
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened,
because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.
they were just providing a plastic sheet,
I started commuting to Kobe,
The color coordination is very important.
such poor construction of the temporary housing,
we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.
This is the first temporary building made out of paper.
They're so poor, and they are freezing
because at that time, the Asahi beer company
just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.
That is our profession, even historically it's the same,
and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso --
I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.
So we went there to build partitions
It just became big, heavy deforestation
we built over 50 units of the shelters.
So I remember it was so disappointing.
so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking,
so they helped us to collect money,
so musicians were moving out.
all the building furniture
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.
Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.
Thank you. I had one big problem.
And this is a very interesting photo:
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.
And I was very lucky.
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints
who lost their houses by natural disasters.
and we proposed to donate this church,
Many of the people want to stay here forever.
we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.
And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees
Very expensive, they throw them out for money,
can be permanent as long as people love it.
but we are working for privileged people,
So they hire us to visualize their power and money
standard government single-story housing like this one.
but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste,
bring your students to build, you can do it."
simply, it's become more difficult to control them.
but there are no architects working there
doesn't want us to do it, because, they said,
because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.
but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.
and also it's very easy to waterproof,
Hi. I am an architect.
making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,
nearly 70,000 people were killed,
And they are very kind, affording my model.
So I proposed to the mayor,
so my building has to be reused or recycled.
at my profession as an architect,
it's also possible to fireproof.
even now we are doing the same.
using these recycled paper tubes
which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.
but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.
I was very happy to hear that.
Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.
So it's very useful.
However, some of the facility authority
It's very complicated to test the new material for the building,
They don't have enough flat area to build
and all the concert halls were destroyed,
and also the students helped us to make
but also the area of the house is exactly the same,
Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.
Thank you. (Applause)
about ecological issues and environmental issues,
people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.
because we are not helping, we are not working for society,
and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government
But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp
Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?
made their plastic beer crates red,
even though there are so many people
but it came empty. (Laughter)
but this is much stronger than I expected,
My goal was when the building was demolished,
and I created a big monument for the government.
for the durability and moisture and termites, so on.
that are beloved by people.
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.
So this is under construction.
even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.
After, the building was recycled.
He said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it."
and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation
Even a building made in paper
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes,
and many Japanese students were also killed,
because each country makes a lot of pavilions
In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake
with the local students in Santo Domingo
People suffer mentally and physically.
and the most important cathedral of the city,
But it's really necessary to do it.
because we are too busy working for privileged people.
we had a big earthquake.
Over two million people became refugees.
with blankets during the rainy season,
I am the only architect in the world
It was meant to stay there for three years,
As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.
We can make it better.
In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.
So this building became a permanent building.
Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit,
because this is so cheap and also so strong,
and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.
also they had a big earthquake,
and an environmental problem.
over 500 square meters.
So that was the goal of my design.
And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan,
So I proposed to rebuild. I raised -- did fundraising.
And also I still remember, we were expecting
In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake,
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.
Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake,
because L'Aquila is very famous for music
I just started testing the paper tube
rich people, government, developers.
"Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"
I'm delighted to be here.
All I need now is to flip on another beam,
I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.
spend hours and hours with me.
No, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years,
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"
My students in El Cerrito -- with my help, of course,
I was talking about this stuff to
All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?
that you climb up this wooden ladder.

He wants to clunk me over the head!
was to measure the speed of light.
It was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,
"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.
However, the "D" in TED of course stands for design.
Right? This is simple physics.
Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound
This cop comes after me with a rifle.
this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for
Having said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.
because our universe has only three spatial dimensions.
And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do --
But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!
It probably has lies in it as well.
it's perfectly capable of doing so
when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems
things that have one side.
pitch goes down, things stretch out.
So, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!
So don't go back and read my dissertation.
one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class --
I take lunch hour. (Applause)
I would dearly love to talk about
Now, so I know the frequency.
upon the Hayes Hall tower bells:
What I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,
And there's no time to do it.
Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.
Oh, before I even turn that on,
To measure the wavelength,
I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.
All of which comes to what I wanted to say.
No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.
So I think locally and I act locally.
but bear with me. (Laughter)
So, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed
But to me, things aren't the future.
I go to a place where a dowel splits off.
but then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!
not bad. Pretty good.
I'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.
Not just showing up every now and then.
And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.
Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,
Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.
Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.
not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there --
I keep climbing up, go back.
you get one of these, and I make them out of glass.
coming out this way.
And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,
I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,
Instead, I'm going to mention my mom,
We're going to be doing genuine physics."
If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,
is right over here. Right over here.
frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here --
but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom
The second time, it's engineering.
Is true. Is true. I teach eighth-grade science four days a week.
OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.
It has wonderful properties.
Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about
do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.
And I'd love to talk about this,
Bessel functions, modulation transfer functions,
So, in order to measure the speed of sound,
they write inscriptions on them.
I don't. Nor, I suspect,
a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.
I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,"
The first time you do something, it's science.
Put your money where you mouth is."
but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer
It is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn."
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms,
is a constant. When the frequency goes up,
I'd love to measure the speed of light here.
Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,
and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.
I would love to talk about my astronomy,
you'll notice the spiral.
I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,
to show Greg Flint and I things about this.
Namely, that when they cast bells,
They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.
Chases me into this room.
You won't need to know trig.
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.
ask an experienced one.
A musician who took time from his life to teach me,
Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.
No calculus, I'll cut out that.
But what I've just made --
For those of you in the audience who know,
I'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,
is not one that is in software.
the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
The cop's chasing me.
Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.
that we have to bring more computers into schools.
but, 20 years later ...
I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."
Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?
from narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.
And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?"
And all of you know the wave equation is
It's one of these bell-tower buildings.
I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.
That was a month of my life.
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.
In the background, my bicycle.
shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.
And I looked at it, and said, oh my god,
We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of
I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around
And I'd love to talk about that -- and it'd be fun --
you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.
I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,
Right away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.
for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,
but they should have, and I wish they had,
ask a kindergarten teacher.
the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.
and stealing information and selling it.
almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.
and the bottom beam is me talking, right?
who passed away this past August.
I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.
and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope --
and I'm like, "Oh my God!"
What they didn't tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics --
But, probably -- one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,
the inventor of the Moog synthesizer,
and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.
but I'm one of the very few people,
I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,
In this light, may science and religion endeavor here
and spend a huge amount of on-screen time,
This man is Robert Moog,
and she had collected a picture of me, standing --
And I caught the guys,
one full wave -- over to here.
Mentoring me. He'd come up and
Let's figure out what this is.
over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.
(Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.)
Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,
It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.
Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics."
I climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,
This guy over here of course is me.
And I looked over her album
This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps.
So Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.
when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging
and he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.
No! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.
I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.
Could somebody put this guy up?
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago.
The wavelength was 0.2 meters.
all I need to do is measure the distance from here --
We're studying physics, I'm studying physics,
I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.
and everything else that I've said.
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,
it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,
to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.
as the pitch goes up, things get closer,
The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.
don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.
And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!
but I guess I may be very wrong about that,
So, I'm not going to talk about that.
but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because --
Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.
if you really want to know about the future,
Soon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.
Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!
who passed away last summer.
And I'd love to talk to you about this,
Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.
over here, that's what's interesting --
"You! You're a student."
that it doesn't need much talking about --
And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.
So I'm not going to talk about that.
I've got a frequency counter right here.
I'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"
In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,
And it sent me back.
A third time, it's just being a technician.
This is a Klein bottle wine bottle,
are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.
I don't have a big enough head.
Certainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things
the square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter)
and measure the speed of light.
we've been able to measure the speed of sound to --
and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere
So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.
all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.
He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me
And I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,
and the police are chasing me, right?
None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.
But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink --
I've decided that, for me at least,
The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,
the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,
go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.
and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!
There's a riot going on on campus,
and we're going to do serious experiments.
It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.
but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?
I slam the door behind me, climb up,
because I've got gray hair,
It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.
It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.
And that constant is the speed of sound.
The entranceway to the bell tower.
the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!
If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.
how come you ain't over here on the front lines?
0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.
you roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay?
But that's not what I'm going to talk about.
In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.
But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.
I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.
No, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,
Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment
or light, you get a constant.
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.
As a technician, repairing and maintaining

I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.

In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,
that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!
is to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate --
but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in
This is a Klein bottle.
Change is happening, and the change that is happening
was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound
Robert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.
I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?
One of the things that I've done for my science students
"Well, how come you ain't teaching?"
So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.
"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"
measured the speed of light.
I'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.
And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,
He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.
I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,
why I believe computers don't belong in schools.
So it's highly -- that one's the cool one.
Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.
some schoolteachers about a year ago.

The one thing though that is really dangerous
there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen.

Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge.

What's happening is we're taking this technology --

MG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,
which should be possible in our lifetime.
Bill's going to be interested in what I learned,
equal ways, is the partner,
a boy, and a girl named Grace.
CA: You've easily got enough money
I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.
Is that your plan for them?
so some things change along the way.
But the thing that we learned from that work,
when somehow your only real rival

And at the end of the trip,
CA: And I think you've pledged that

and took some time to walk on the beach,
CA: Well, I really think that most people here
BG: All right, good job. (Applause)
and what turned out to be the fundamental key,
That, to me, really changes
But we don't every minute together, that's for sure.
you can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,

Grace was not a child, she was an adolescent,
She's got a lot of insight.
and the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,
It's incredible how people think, okay,
but it was really on that beach walk
and others supported.
BG: No, I'm kidding. MG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away.
to be very clear with them --
Jenn's been to Tanzania.
And we'd already been talking about during that time

And even though I'm Catholic,

but not a lot of money showered on them

It tries to balance out, and that's just.
and I finally realized I just had to do it.

Grace went immediately,
how afraid he was that unlike the son,
more than half of their assets for philanthropy.
And at night, though,
because we've certainly had them.
MG: But you change systems.
and we saw that as the way that the U.S.
that could be me, and the money flows.
when Bill was working at Microsoft.
that you like that illustrates your work,
on a path that turned out to have
I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,
who had passed his secondary exams,
Does it have to be like this?
How do you navigate that?
I mean, Bill made this decision
Now that the Millennium Development Goals
do you hire staff, what do you give to them?
CA: Maybe it needed someone
and about 60 million,
or the data or what he's learned,
Because the delivery piece
And they start to see others doing it, and saying,
and got the translator,
It is not all a panacea.
and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned
so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,
BG: Because we built this thing
is to pick different approaches,
and that the kids were so sick
and became full time.
and this was the trip where we really went to see
and so we got back to that global consensus,
were saying they wanted access to contraceptives,
getting the vaccines out to kids.
BG: A few of them did, but —
And part of the reason I'm so optimistic
It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time
to make them all billionaires.
BG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.
in the perception of that problem.
or this person that is a great leader.
suddenly turned around and agreed to give
and if it's not good for your kids,
MG: Yeah. I think actually,
and say, "I want to act based on these global statistics."
for the foundation, actually, as we used to
and there we looked at children dying,
adjusting to that. No?
which is not widely known,
MG: So we went to Tanzania.
People give to some things.
in the early days of Microsoft.
and survival and literacy
And recently, you and Warren

So Bill can look at the big data

It does seem to me that if more of your peers

it was going to get out there.

you have shaped the future.
you're away from work,

I can't think of anything where one of us

is to take that data
children not having enough nutrition to ever develop,
I had that with Paul Allen
MG: But that went away within three months,
but she wasn't an adult.
what I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda
that you know you're going to have different failures.
CA: So, given that this vacation
Well, turns out it took an injection
Tragically, she passed away before he did,
Six years ago, I guess,
and Melinda, this is what you picked.
more than, or 95 percent of your wealth,
and could you have a big impact on them?
they clearly had respect and love in the relationship.
CA: I mean, you do the math on this,
and on the abortion question,
We married a few months later,
against these huge global problems,
largely running the show.
is a far, far bigger story than that.
MG: And having people see that other people
and the more we learned, the more we realized
Maybe a few of those will work out.
on their little compound before we got there.
which is an injection they were getting called Depo-Provera,
and a world full of so many different issues.
And what you find is really
using the science of new vaccines,
We need more experimentation.
You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,
in the cooking hut that day,
because with that level of death,
It took three more years to get it than we expected,
We were already engaged to be married.
We started asking ourselves questions.
CA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.
so the goal is to get this well below a million,
over and over and over, the more I traveled,
including even in one space, like education.
and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars
MG: That's what I said, the employees,
"But what about the shot I get?"
and we really, really learned
when we look back on it.
"Well that can't be.

while we were dating.
We come at things from different angles,
What about failure, though?

which is, to have the number one thing

Does that drive you crazy?

that they'd get huge population growth,
on both sides, really.
of whether that student will be ready for college.
There was a lot we didn't know.
and then in the U.S.,
BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,
can I have your headlamp
That just wouldn't work out."
Is anything, the story of what's gone right there
by the time you're done,
We'll take the different trips she described.
and is willing to do it at no charge,
CA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,
They had six children, and as I talked to Anna
They invited us to come and stay in their boma.
and it's been way more successful than we expected.
and give to the least wealthy, it's good.
where you want to get that number to continue,
in its continuous learning journey,
It was a very loving relationship.
All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.
and parents would have so many kids

And he knows when he comes home,
and read up to the global data and see if they match,
you could say wasted five years,
So there's a lot of collaboration.
These causes have been a bit invisible.
these inequities, to me that was exciting.
How on Earth do you decide what to focus on?
which is, we had backed away from contraceptives
have been going around trying to persuade
it's this great partnership.
You know, we enjoy it, and we don't --
And just taken about three weeks ago, I think,
Were there things that weren't being done?
in education, I think, something like that.
in her child's mouth?
there is some aid that was well-meaning
and now Melinda, and in even stronger,
that the wealth that had come from Microsoft
that seems structural.
But it's been wonderful, meeting those people,
I can't pay for private school,
BG: That's the most important.
and do a few things that way.
is the envy of the world.
And I would come back and talk to global health experts,
and to me that was just a crime,
We want to strike a balance where they have
MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us
Anyway, this is a chart
whether it's Bangladesh, India, lots of countries in Africa,
MG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel
CA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.
you probably can have success there,
are just in awe of the trajectory
"I really don't think I could work with my husband.
BG: Yeah, well people can take,
put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.
"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband.
to now we're down to about six million.
BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,
We go from 20 million
and this is what the team came to me with,
where we'd get to work together
I was actually really excited.
And so condoms were stocked in in Africa
where they're doing it differently,
both in that problem and certainly
you've had some amazing successes.
for a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,
and figure out how to give this money back.
MG: Which Bill always thought was going to come
We knew that 210 million women
and we weren't providing them
every day for 10 days.
I meet with lots of people on the ground
BG: Including some of the employees.
and yet, people's charity,
what might we do and how might we go about it?
I don't care how big or small the building is,
It's allowed us to increase our ambition
versus staying overnight was profound,
you used basically this argument to say that aid,
in the fall of 1993.
Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports,
just like most of the Catholic women in the United States
and I kept looking around trying to find the person
than ever in history,
that actually it has been effective.
Melinda, early on, you were basically
and I shouldn't let that controversy
We used to have consensus in the United States
and we kept saying to ourselves,
Melinda, when and where was this,
MG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.
come from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.
and I think we have a really collaborative relationship.
Are there any failures that you can talk about?
could live up to its promise of equal opportunity
That's the role of philanthropy
CA: Traditional wisdom is that
Well, we got hundreds of ideas.
Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that.
took the approach that you two have made,
maybe that's okay. But we were stunned.
you're not going to change the trajectory
we're not really fulfilling that promise.
and countries that were really stuck,
CA: So Melinda, this is you and
and he was starting to think of this idea.
CA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,
It's a kid, one kid at a time.
and you've often been embroiled
This is the number of children
BG: Thank you. MG: Thank you.
we can just go wipe out the disease.
BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy
She'll sit down with the employees a lot.
there was way more angst for them
most of the money's going to the foundation --
the first time either of us had ever been to Africa,
And we stayed with their family,
This is in Africa, our very first trip,
and they'd say, "Oh no, contraceptives
who have now taken this giving pledge.
has nothing to do with natural disasters,
For me, I come at it from intuition.
and say wow, this is going well,
So they know the difference
CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,
living in that particular little hut
MG: Well, here's the thing.
Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excited
around exactly this issue for women.
Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?
There are probably some billionaires in the room
for the foundation employees,
something really amazing happened in 2006,
The world is a far better place
that that would be the phase,
and who is that handsome man next to you?
and many millions around the world
where Warren Buffett talked about that,
because of the political controversy in our country,
she'd not done so well
for some people to figure out
That's down to a few hundred thousand.
and certainly some successful people.
and so I just love the fact that
that number has dropped faster
who report using contraceptives,
the world's biggest private foundation,
CA: How about you, Melinda, though? Can you? (Laughter)
I mean, the beauty of philanthropy
They have less violence and crime in those schools.
so they could go out and do nothing.
and everything the foundation does
be the thing that holds us back.
That must have been hard,
not long after I was born
BG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.
MG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,
But women will tell you over and over again,
I'm curious, can you make the pitch?
who is turned on by numbers and graphs
CA: And since this relationship, it's amazing—
That was eradicated, so that got down to zero.
So that was '93, and it was '97, really,
and you can't take it with you,
We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.
let's get together and brainstorm
I mean, you've used it in your letter this year,
with her REI little headlamp on,
And for me, the excitement of Bill
because we don't have a perfect record,
the two in the middle were twins, 13,
and so let me just give you one explanation of that.
because of the philanthropists of the past,
BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.
rather than just the big, sad face
I really like this graph.
which things should we give more to,
An airliner with 200-plus deaths
two nights and three days with a family.
and I think what I've taught him
your eldest daughter, Jenn.
the births of their children.
We look and go, "Wow."
We've got time for the short version.
both of us have had amazing educations,
Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size
learning about what had worked and what had failed,
can you actually deliver that vaccine?
"I want to be able to use this shot."
it would make a dent
your lives have taken
So, we're going to start here.
And we did something very different,
very modest benefit when we got there.
MG: Totally stunned. BG: We had never expected it,
At this stage, we were talking about the poorest,
some images that would help explain
which groups are working well?
whatever the biggest inequity was globally,
Measles was killing a couple million a year.
and I go in as a Western woman without a name.
that their own work is meaningful and important.
I guess there's a long version and a short version of that.
MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article
about one thing or another?
and shine some light in the right direction.
CA: Which of you was the key instigator here,
some of what they've done,
And so we picked those two things,
to thousands of kids' lives saved every day
I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,
CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year
came straight up to my Jenn and said,
We can do better than venture capital, I think,
If they put their ideas and their brain
But what really touched us, actually, were the people,
that I thought, once I got this drug,
We have more trips where we're traveling separately,
and we don't travel together as much
and maybe what you've learned from it?
and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do,
The thing that's great is that we get together
80 percent of his fortune
and take some of these things
And so we started gathering scientists
compared to the prior year.
and quite frankly, the work is better because of it.
They need to have a sense
so these countries can take care of themselves,
or three quarters of a day
CA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?
BG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,
which is, we decided to go spend
or something new about the vaccine delivery chain,
use the very latest understanding of these things,
and I need that tool because then I can space
was in late 1998, 1999.
So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.
Half the resources we have
BG: Thank you. MG: Thank you very much.
I believe in contraceptives
I mean, these are people who have
than there was for me about Bill coming.
so we talk a lot about
Most of the time, art and science stare at each other
This is a view of what's called the calving face.
across the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.
Right now, if you look at the top right part of that graph,
and the processes either are accelerating
It now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.
We've got 33 cameras out this moment.
We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks,
to merging the art and science
The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,
We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.
But 280 is the peak.
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking.
There's a marker line called the trim line
There's a lot of people working on this right now.
And on up to Greenland.
Some of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes.
But anyway, off to the world of ice.
iceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise.
the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,
that shows you that a little bit.
and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.
We are nearly on the edge of a crisis,
And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating.
So an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.
and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads,
We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat,
Because I believe we have an opportunity right now.
This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.
And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,
breaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,
The changes are happening. They're very visible.
There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,
is the Ilulissat Glacier.
into 25 time-lapse cameras.
That's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that
ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph,
I'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,
in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia.
That's the retreat of this glacier.
and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.
One of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.

We have to turn that around.
When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models,
Finally catches up to itself, it advances.
These changes in the alpine world are accelerating.
like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact
Now I've come to the conclusion
off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.
like air is being let out of a balloon.
In this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.
Well, within about three weeks,
and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.
Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.
And that's where I think organizations like TED,
things that can be measured and described --
To give you a little bit of a sense of scale,
At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.
as recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,
And everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?
but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating,
This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.
We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.
Geologic process in action here.
because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now.
A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys
What do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?
they're not normal landscapes --
and shape the way we think about nature
and let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever
These great ice islands break off --
This camera was shooting every hour.
is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.
Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder?
Here's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska.
That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable,
If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was.
These huge crevasses open up.
as recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,
Number one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
Now we turn on our time lapse.
And the great irony and tragedy of our time
and so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story,
It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.
is it raining more or is it raining less?
have tremendous powers for helping us understand
and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,
that I should station a camera or two at a glacier
June, May, then October.
and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film.
The interior of Greenland is to the right.
and floating if it isn't.
you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.
has gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius,
and how much ice is charging out.
Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places,
And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there.
am firmly of the belief that photography, video, film
And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,
If you look in the middle background,
I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,
almost a million years before our current time.
Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier,
So, imagine how big this is
I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature
during the months when we built these units originally.
going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock,
You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this,
after that assignment was finished --
This exact same pattern is seen going back now
but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.
who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,
I spent half my life at our local hardware store
last time we went into Columbia.
to the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.
That's what you see with these cameras.
twice the rate it did 20 years ago.
So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep
Without the photographic process, you would never see this. This is invisible.
There is great confusion when the two look at each other.
Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer
way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the
And one crazy day, I got the idea that I should --
but on average, 125 feet a day,
you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? --
all across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened.
but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed
I personally obsessed about every nut, bolt and washer in these crazy things.
So that's where we started three years ago,
conventional, single frame, still photography.
We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.
But in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak.
It tends to go in these pulses, about every three days,
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,
This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do --
Greenland took a little while to start reacting
and humanity's relationship with nature better.
I'm certain that we can.
They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.
we're at 385 parts per million.
I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,
or the predictions were too low to begin with.
That's outside Antarctica.
Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale, quickly dwarfed.
Ice is the canary in the global coal mine.
We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago
of our generation and, in fact, of our century.
but we actually can deal with them.
these things you don't normally get to see come alive.
because this is the story that counts.
and like our relationship with the Obama White House,
above our little red illustration there.
Here's a two-year record of what that looks like.
But ice has another meaning.
The smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.
You can see it deflating.
And that led me to this project.
So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career,
These first images are from Greenland.
but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge
The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,
You can see this river being formed.
trying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.
A mile of retreat in 75 minutes
because there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing
there would be no further societal argument about climate change
Here's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made.
watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat.
and it's going very rapidly up that stem.
We have a problem of perception.
looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.
for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here.
And you can look at these pictures over and over again
This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.
They're photographable. They're measurable.
and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED,
as an ambassador for my whole team.
we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together,
In any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.

I'll show you one of those in a second.
It's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight

Actually, there's still a camera out there right now.

Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.
That's the natural cycle.
monster calving events happened.
Similarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community,
on human perception and bring us along.
In the Extreme Ice Survey,
where the ice is, it's real and it's present.
And so, there are features on this landscape.
than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined
is about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.
I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras
Huge icebergs rolling over.
Now, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.
as you can see. June 25th,
that puts more ice into the global ocean
that is places we just visit on an annual basis,
This is an aerial picture we did this year.
but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.
that calving face in this picture
It's been a remorseless, steady increase.
No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier.
In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago,
All of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,
The one glacier up in Greenland
and we have repeat photography positions,
That's where it started.
We actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,
A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.
Science is not arguing about that.
as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.
and about ourselves in relationship to nature.
We go back a couple years in time.
and watch the progression of the landscape over time.
You can see that from the orange line and the blue line.
You know, scientists have collected this kind of information
just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland,
But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.
and you're about to see the consequences of that floating.
because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.
go up and down basically in sync.
This is what a couple of the cameras saw.
Icebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea.
So we wind time backwards now.
Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative --
and they watch the evolution of the landscape.
it would be equivalent to how large that block was.
and it's going to keep going up
We had nine cameras going.
The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public.
one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick,
are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.

That's only half our job.

but the camera records it.
Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world
we did another cheesy illustration,
And you see where it ended in these various spring days,
We have a site on Google Earth
But, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984

There is no significant scientific dispute about that.
Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.
that tells the camera when to fire.

Earth is having a fever.
So, here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia.
We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.
and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.
and in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.
And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work.
and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.
to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.
because not enough people really get it yet.
Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record.
and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.
as much as possible with these pictures as well.
The calving face is four and a half miles across,
to the warming climate of the past century,
But what we have is a perception problem
You see the glacier flowing in from the right,
and if you compare the expanse of the calving face
and seeing the unseen at TED Global.
because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.
It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.
This is a terrific, terrific call to arms
across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.
The block was three-fifths of a mile deep,
We've been talking about "seeing is believing "
Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion.
with the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy
and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile,
but in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.
Initially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment --
to the end of helping us understand nature
And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.
Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,

like pesticides and herbicides,
how can I change? How can I change these things?
It seems to me like corporations
because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.
it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,
and people have been eating food produced this way

or genetically modified seeds.

With all these things I've been learning about the food system,
on TV, at public schools
The food they produce have been proven
from where it's grown to the supermarkets.
My little cousin told his dad
I also used to think that all of our food
has been altered genetically in some way.
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.
from growing the same crop over and over again.
This man, this "lunatic farmer,"
in every community popping up.
like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee --
all the marketing and advertising
The seeds are then planted, then grown.
so it can travel thousands of miles
Yet almost all the corn we eat
I went to go hear him speak one day.
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive,
I must admit, I used to be one of them.
I want you to know that there are farms out there --
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients
you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.
Since I'm home-schooled,
that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,
or our neighbors who we know in real life.
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.
Now I know definitely which one I would choose.
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.
What I discovered was this is not true.
that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.
if they know more about it and where it really comes from.
but this is just creepy.
or the sugarcoated flakes --
choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.

Sex was very painful.
and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop,
I'm still waiting for an apology, by the way.
And once again, I was an angry black woman.
Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it.
She couldn't answer my questions,
My periods were heavy, they were long, and they were very painful.
Don't ask me why a man needs more than one wife.
We came from two different worlds.
I lived in a society that was very clitoris-centric.
I was told I was pregnant.

And I said, "Am I asexual now?

It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving.
there's a four-year old
I'm proud to tell you,
It took us three days to get here.
about what female genital mutilation was
called Women's Health Statewide,
I remembered what was done to me.
Are you going to let this evil of female genital mutilation
and then when she was done,
I channel all that anger, all that pain, into advocacy
but it became harder when I started volunteering for an organization
Apparently, white men have a problem finding the clitoris.
if they never had that conversation?
Do you know the millions of dollars
They then went into a whole discussion where she said to him,
but I had no recollection of what had happened.
When she was growing up, not having a clitoris was the norm.
She had a chat with my mom, and went back.

Then they sleep around with everybody.
because she thought she did it out love --
He said, "Oh, this is my cultural belief."
And I thought to myself, I had an inner joke in my head
and dammit, ever child has a right to a clitoris.
I don't know where she read that publication. (Laughter)
Just saying, it wasn't me. It was Dolly that said that.
That's what I have to say to that.
Did anybody watch "Blood Diamond"?
that said, "I will marry a white man.
I went home and I said to my mom,
So I'm the director of an organization called No FGM Australia.
And she said to me, "Who is Dolly and Girlfriend?
Type I is when they cut off the hood.
that I should be having orgasms,
because every child has a right to pleasure.
there's a four-year-old whose mom is planning on performing FGM on her.
that in this society was called barbaric,
"what you did out of love is harming me, and it's hurting me.
There are so many women out there who have gone through FGM
"Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure, and do you know
What do you have to say for that?"
We spent 15 minutes opening the tap like this.
There was always the sealed section. Anybody remember those sealed sections?
Anyway, there was always an article about pleasure
This old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever,
There were no Asians, no indigenous.
Settling in Australia was quite hard,
I was like, "No, they're not. That's a magazine, mom, a magazine."
Her children would have been flown over to Malaysia
What are you going to do?
Before all of this, I pretty much had amnesia.
"You did something."
A couple of months ago, I met a lady who is married to a Malaysian man.
I want ever single one of you to see FGM as an issue for you.
I thought she was going to slaughter me,
I was an African Australian girl.
So please join me in ending this act.
If you have any thoughts --
Type II is when they cut off the whole clitoris
"Your act, your action, no matter what your may defense may be" --
All we had was some tan girls,
FGM, I will just say FGM for short.
So I came home once again and said to my mom,
The next day, I woke up,
Every child has a right to their bodies being left intact,
I realized I didn't have normal periods because of FGM.
Two days ago, I had to call Child Protective Services,
And she said, "Why?" He said they were dirty.
because I needed my pain to be worth something.
She put us in a car,
that even in our beloved Australia,
"Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure,
crying, and confused as to what just happened.
I knew I had a scar down there,
She said, "You're empowered, Khadija.
It was all about the damn clitoris!
I thought, "Wow, is this my existence? Is this what life is all about?"
Never found evidence of it to this day.
so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation.
I struggled and tried to get her off me, but I couldn't.
That child is in kindy. I'll let that sink in: four years old.
Then the old lady came towards me with a rusty-looking knife,
I screamed, I cried,
Six hundred white kids, and I was the only black child there.
and this is when you had the Sydney Olympics at the time,
one of the sharp knives,
It's not white, it's not black, it has no color, it's everybody's problem.
There may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of FGM.
That was the end of our first conversation.
I didn't remember any of it.
and I thought, this doesn't fit me.
Are they your new friends, Khadija?"
You have invaded me in the most sacred way.
because of what was done to me.
Will I just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex,
"I was 13. I was a child.
Men, do you need more than one wife?
I was like, these people and their damned clitoris.

What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.
We'd like to know these things.
do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little,
and said, which of them should we do first?
And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling,
sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.
why don't we spend that on doing good in the world?
It's not about making things that have the most media attention,
it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?
and who needed the help so much more?"
And so the real point, of course, is to say,
of all the big things that we can do in the world,
The fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these --
I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process,
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.
and 10 times as much good in prevention.
So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.
You know, we spend 100 billion dollars --
It could be a family-size pizza;
We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.
I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?
and which one should we do afterwards?

To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.
It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.
But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.
we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.
I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes,
But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?
And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated.
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.
The lists go on and on.
You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.
eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates,
but you have no idea what the price is.
if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.
but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.
So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path
Then we had some of the world's top economists,
and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe,
than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense
And that is really why it becomes a bad project.
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world,
That is what economists do.
we could make a severe inroad into that problem.
Since then our aid has halved.
when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.
But of course, we don't do all problems.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars,
What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?
And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list
on doing very little good?

but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.
Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.
I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.
And that's the question I'd like to ask you.

What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models,
But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.
which ones should we solve first?
I think we should do all things, but we don't.
because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.
What can we do? What will be the cost
It's a good film in the sense that
So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have,
We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare
not the things that we don't know how to do,
And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil --
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.
There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.
And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.
in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree.
to try and get out pen and paper

and went in and talked about it.
If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
is probably some of the top priorities.
Or did you get close to what we came up with here?
Of course, we should do all things,
as if we actually did the prioritization,
we start thinking about both sides of the equation.
people will be much, much richer.

with malnutrition and diseases at the top
Where should we start on solving these problems?
where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.
there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.
is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice.
But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?
We could avoid about 500,000 people dying,
Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.
but also to start thinking about political triage.
I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say,
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar --
what do you think are the biggest things?
we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?
And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves --
very radically fast, in about two to five years.
And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.
we could bring that incidence down to half.
One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years,
Map out the right path for the world --
to come up with their own lists.
The obvious question would be to ask,
Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying
if you get another 100 billion dollars,
We don't actually solve all problems.
simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do,
What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.
encompass the biggest problems in the world.
but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years,
So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing --
So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.
one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.
getting much better information for 2008, 2012.
The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto --
We believe that these in many ways
and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.
we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.
In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't.
Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull
every year for affected nations.
So I think that really does tell us why it is
but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it,
Which is a little good, but not very much good.
that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.
So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment,
Of course, you can also see it on the website,
There are many, many problems out there.
The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them
half of which would accrue to the Third World.
and think about how we better work for the world.
The majority of them were, first, from developing countries.
To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.
because it's probably one of the things
Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years,
We called them the "dream team."
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP
So I hope this will help us make better priorities,
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.

To climate change that would be like Kyoto.

malnutrition and hunger, population migration,
to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year,
and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more,
yet we've never actually made a fundamental list
we end by not worrying about other things.
that we focus on the right ones.
Why is it it came up?
we can do X amount of good in treatment,
financial instability, governance and corruption,
Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.
We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years,
If we worry too much about some things,
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.
And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.
Basically for the amount of money that we spend,
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university,
climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education,
of suddenly solving all big problems.
we could basically enliven the global economy
as a defense for boring problems.
and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather
not to want to do such a list.
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.
The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean,
Yet it would do very little good.
And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems,
Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.
where people will say I shouldn't come back, either.
by investing in prevention.
to come and solve the same problem.
and I will just briefly read them:
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first,
That would be the second best investment that we could do.
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.
and the whole discussion of priorities
The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria.
to the world's biggest issues.
that we give the Third World every year.
There are many problems out there in the world.
and saying, what is the important thing in the world?
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world
Two billion people without sanitation.
So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card,
about helping me a little bit through climate change,
But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people,
but we have to be honest and frank about saying,
and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have
That's two to three times the global development aid
So the point is not to prioritize problems,
This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things
So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more
There's a billion people without clean drinking water.
Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade,
It just doesn't make for as much of a movie.
We have not had an idea.
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?
And of course, we'll be even richer than that.
with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these,
and just figure out what should be the top priorities
That's a substantial amount of money.
But we don't have a technology to solve that, right?
great ways of looking at the entire world.
to do good in this world, where should we spend it?
you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.
There are 800 million people starving.
What would be the price?
digging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter)
which should be at least the first ones that we deal with
At the end of the day, you can disagree
if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.
And they're not necessarily, you know,
I'm just going to list some of them.
So I'd like to show you the top four priorities
thinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.
Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.
We should also do climate change,
These were the bad projects.
Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in
Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.
will be about as rich as we are today.
amount of good, at very low cost, right now."
Because we can't solve problems.
so that we end up with the best projects.
So get out your pen and paper.
and what will be the benefit of that?
I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich
and education to every single human being on the planet.
to put down what are the things we should not do, first.
They all come out with very much the same list.
I'm going to go from backwards
But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well,
You know, when you ask the world's best economists,
to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with --
And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.
The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria,
Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way
We would significantly increase their ability
is very little, at a very high cost.
We've done this many other times.
That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.
I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?
if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves,
because that's a very good question.
So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.
We have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" -- it looks great, right?
Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be --
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.
we could solve all major basic problems in the world.
not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost,
But it's saying that what we can do about it
and climate change at the bottom.
But that's a wrong problem to ask.
Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.
One is treatment; the other one is prevention.
and think about what are the right priorities.
And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- (Laughter) --
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.
And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you
but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people
why on Earth was such a list never done before?
for about 75 billion dollars a year,
To start thinking about saying, "Let's do
It's not saying that it's not a big problem.
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back
And then you ask, why economists?
That would be the third best thing we could do.
We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.
if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good
Of course, you have to ask yourself,
the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount,
when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be,
is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense
It's not saying that global warming is not happening.
It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.
to think about, how do we actually prioritize?
And just to give you a sense of reference,
is simply because it's very inefficient.
there were bad projects -- basically, projects
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.
The other objections, I think, that are important to say,
probably that's also a good choice.
Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.
any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing,
Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh,
and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards,
or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal
They basically came up with a list where they said
That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.
two to three hundred million people out of poverty,
I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" --
to try to put prices on these issues.
we need to get our priorities straight.
100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?
And I also strongly encourage you,
outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did,
the Real Madrid of economics.
And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do --
and that's actually what we did.
To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.
They had all the same material but they could go vastly
Karachi was about 500,000 people in 1947, a hustling, bustling city.
Now, this is actually a good news story.
But we're facing a stark dilemma
If you live in Rio, I'm sorry, shave off two right there.
Violence is going virtual.
In other words, 10 times more people are dying outside of war than inside war.

and if we can get to grips with these,
We've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation,

We also got to focus on those hot people.

These two facts -- the decline in armed conflict and the decline in murder --
Manuel Eisner and others have shown
seem to think we can, and so do I,
and it did this by doubling down
and as a result, we're seeing violence going down in their communities.
Place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities.
One way to do this might be to start twinning
So let me start with some good news.
I call this turbo-urbanization, and it's one of the key drivers of fragility.
Citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions.

As a result, city enthusiasts, they talk about the triumph of the city,

So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.
And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.

I write down things that I know about it.

Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace,

The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea --

and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper
Then I got the words "new" and "old"
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be,
by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old,
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.

He apparently lost an eye in battle,
I could make nothing of that.
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster,
you've got to keep it moving --
and there wasn't a lot of information in it.
I guess one could reduce the idea further
so I worked very hard on this.
surrealism has become banal,
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
there doesn't seem to be an argument there.
And then I did some variations of it,
Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.

I said, "Well, it's so persuasive,

I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach,

Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
the new emerges from the context of the old.
This could be embarrassing.
in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro,"
So I took another crack at it --
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?
I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation,

I was asked, I guess about six years ago,
and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.
So, there's that little alternative over there,
I mean -- you've got to be confident;
Be not the first by whom the new are tried/
and if you don't like that, how about the little one?
and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.

and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
based on a work by Piero,
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N,
What's the heart of this poem?
Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.

they use the word 'reliable.'
And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of,
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts --

It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.

Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA
I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever,"
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit --
I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman --
and know that they're going to be ripped off,
I was really desperate at this point.
And as you know, you have to have a front.
but as soon as you hear Dutchman,
And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/
because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow,
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting,
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope"
you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?
a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.
"Art is whatever remains."
It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro,
Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.

and the shape of the thing.
Now, this is a little illusion.
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
Now this says, "Note to the viewer:
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject,

So as a photographer, I wanted to explore what this problem really looks like.
This is one of those alternatives.
but over time we started losing our native pollinators,
but National Geographic asked me to photograph a story about them,
so researchers are working on finding alternatives
that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites,
and the USDA is integrating their mite-resistant bees into his operation
and sucks their blood.
they'll be able to select the bees that are not only mite-resistant
This is what it takes to breed bees in a lab.

on two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone,
can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.
like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.
or a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink,
and no status and no power.
So you can be standing or you can be sitting.
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power.
and having an out-of-body experience,
So that's what I did.
and for me it was being smart,
Again, this is not about you talking to other people.
Here's what you get on cortisol.
When we think about communication, we think about interactions.
So when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others,
From their baseline when they come in,

that you change your posture for two minutes.
So if someone is being really powerful with us,
when they win at a physical competition.
and then we take another saliva sample.

for two minutes, we say, "You need to do this or this."
Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.

It's you talking to yourself.
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior,
So in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.
And that really resonated with me,
So that's what we want to test. Okay?
So we have this evidence, both that the body can shape
and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life.
So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant,
emoticons used well in online negotiations
So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom,
and I had been called gifted as a child.
and they do either high- or low-power poses again,
You know, we're interested in, like, you know — (Laughter) —
is, can power posing for a few minutes
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
There's some evidence that they do.
This expression, which is known as pride,
what happens if you do that at a really minimal level,
We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.

I'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking,
their judgments of the physician's niceness
or doing a job interview.
And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes
within a few days, that individual's testosterone has gone up
"I'm not supposed to be here."
So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically,
You're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone --
So for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.
Here's what we find on testosterone.
and then you get these differences in grades,

like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention?
can lead to you claim more value from that negotiation.
So powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly,
But before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now
And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations,
high on testosterone, but really stress reactive?
It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.
and I teach at a competitive business school,
They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.

When you're in the low-power pose condition,
It took me four years longer than my peers,

They don't look at pictures of the poses.
So when I tell people about this,

Women feel chronically less powerful than men,
These kinds of things.
We make ourselves small.
I don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.

It's about opening up.
But really, power is also about how you react to stress.
So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack,
So it goes both ways.
I notice a couple of things about this.
and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase.
Leave that situation feeling like,
The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this.
because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor
and what do I notice?
so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating.
or really stress-reactive, and feeling sort of shut down.
you're hunching up, making yourself small,
Like, can you do this just for a little while

For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University,

and I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?
I was thrown from the car.
But the next question, of course,
and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment.
like social threat situations.
and people turned around and were like,
That's it. That's the whole experiment.
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.
So I started to wonder, you know, okay,
but also, when we're forced to smile
which was very traumatic.
So you're folding up, you're making yourself small.
and would it lead them to participate more?
and we're particularly interested in other people's body language.
I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice,
You're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do.
So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas,
because I took a gamble on you, and you're staying.
That's what you want to do.
So what nonverbals am I talking about?
And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful,
and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease.
And tomorrow you're going to fake it,
I don't want to feel like an impostor.
in just one second predict 70 percent
So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings
And the night before my first-year talk,
I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart,
So again, two minutes, and you get these changes.
shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips
So this is what we did.
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall."
you're more likely to do this,
so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.
Narrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10.
You know? And she gave the best comment ever,
So this is what happens.
So when they cross the finish line and they've won,
Probably not, right?
you take up space, you're basically opening up.
having your identity taken from you, your core identity,
And here are the low-power poses.
Even more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.
so they look like this.
more assertive and more confident, more optimistic.
Don't leave that situation feeling like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.
but not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back.
We are also influenced by our nonverbals,
So what does that mean? When you think about power,
So this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.
having that taken from you,
We decided that the one that most people could relate to
So, we're really fascinated with body language,
and also that role changes can shape the mind.
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?
to take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton,
Like, she can fake it, she can become it.
So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.
You have other people who are virtually collapsing
think and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence.
Also, our bodies change our minds.
predict whether or not that physician will be sued.
So you make yourself big, you stretch out,
by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.
they go through a very stressful job interview.
So what happens, okay, you take a role change,
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves,
and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings,
If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this.
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?
We tend to forget, though, the other audience
that configure your brain
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
and even, let's go digital,
Fake it till you become it.
So this really spikes your cortisol.
I was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.
And this is really important in the MBA classroom,
or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists --
When you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.
You're just going to do it and do it and do it,
we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them.
And so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it.
So we know that in primate hierarchies,
You get these equally qualified women and men coming in
and they say, "We want to hire these people,"
Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down.
what am I talking about?
When they sit down, they're sort of spread out.
when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it.
so we know that our minds change our bodies,
and you are going to give the best comment ever."
because participation counts for half the grade.
that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior,
because that was about dominance.
Because we rate them on all these variables
So the second question really was, you know,
They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance.
So it doesn't have to do so much
She was like, "You are not quitting,
It's five minutes long. They are being recorded.
and they end up looking at these sets of tapes,
but is it also true that our bodies change our minds?
I don't have ego involved in this. (Laughter)
So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.
Here comes the Prime Minister -- No. (Laughter) (Applause)
our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.
and also I want to ask you to share the science, because this is simple.
for two minutes, try doing this, in the elevator,
Even the BBC and The New York Times.
so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.
and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.
So I said, fake it till you make it.
and all it requires of you is this:
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?
They're being judged also,
Unlike the balancing pole,
it is only through repeated practice
mainly used in gaming.
until we're all back on planet Earth,
So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete?
We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations.
we discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it.
They are inherently unstable,
For example, that's how we can make the quad hover.
Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom
we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.
and we can change the laws of physics.
that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution.
Third, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad
Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry?
Will the vaulter stick the landing?
this camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location
with algorithms that exploit this new configuration.
What happens when we couple this machine athleticism
but roll, pitch and acceleration can still be controlled
for filming the remainder of this demonstration.
and then use that information to modify its behavior
This quad has a racket strapped onto its head
to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad.
We added the mathematical model of the pole
I will use this new capability to position
Like all our past creations and innovations,
with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters,
or when a vaulter is twisting in the air,
to launch the ball back to me.
Mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan
with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures.
We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured.
We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball
and you're probably also asking yourself,
serve as an indoor global positioning system.
to that of the quad.
Once we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics,
why exactly are they building machine athletes?
It becomes a little bit more difficult
or 50 times per second.
and the workings of the physical world.
with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large.
We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine.
The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms,
because there are four degrees of freedom to control:
Similar to the diver and the vaulter,
Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it.
They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team.
or they may be misused and abused.
So, how did it just do that?
Here, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid.
And that's why you don't need to model the glass.
Hexacopters and octocopters, with six and eight propellers,
As time goes on, gravity will be increased
these guys are having way too much fun,
We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory
It can recognize what my various body parts
These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net.
In fact, when fully extended,
just like human athletes do,
Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible.
because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.
Notice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical.
where I want it to be in space.
Others think that it has more of a social role,
We now have a natural way of interacting
I can point to where I want the quad to be in space
Instead, what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly,
as far as the quad is concerned, of course.
to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me.
but quadrocopters are much more popular
Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage?
that the maneuver can be learned and executed
Here, you see that it's stable,
and that understanding the physics of the problem
Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy.
They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver
You put these two things together,
Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop
Let's have a little bit of fun with this.
can provide redundancy,
and even if I give it little nudges,
We first figure out where the ball is going.
to create new algorithms for machines
which means that it can be located in the space.
from its current state to the impact point with the ball.
The second is that the propellers
Conventional wisdom says
We relinquish control of yaw,
observe how it finishes the maneuver,
Take this quad, for example.
Look out for them. They're destined for great things.
a cooperative strategy 50 times per second.
It's the magic that brings these machines to life.
to push them to their limits.
they can do it collectively.
We can use mathematical models
Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover
and the research to achieve it
they may be used to improve the human condition
instead of building machines with redundancy.
Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports.
We're being corrected,
and I think I was drawing,
Now when we're young,
and so I did. I became a cartoonist.
to help me deal with this fear.
There were plenty of role models all around us.
even though I follow them half the time,
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.
and each woman has to deal with these same things
because of our tenuous position
and our role as tradition-keepers,
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
are constantly being monitored by the culture.
Now what if you put together women and humor?
for the power of cartoons
is a particularly --
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
the little glass ceiling of cartooning,"
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools
the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,
and dress and traditions,
how women have such strong perceptions,
and she didn't buy me pink outfits.
Now the rules that I'm talking about
and that's what elicits a laugh.
and it's given me a greater appreciation
I was launched as a cartoonist.
And on top of all off these rules,
countries such as Saudi Arabia,
I know I didn't, and I still don't,
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break
I've learned to be flexible.
what the most important color in the world is.
but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,
and it makes it unexpected,
that something's expected of us.
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations,
with women cartoonists from across the world --
and many of us don't --
-- try to bring my family together with laughter.
that each culture has its different codes of behavior
-- and how to behave.
but I've learned to pretend.
and I could still get approval.
really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
not quite aware that I'm following them --
She was a homemaker,
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,
I realized there are not many women in cartooning.
we always have this vague notion
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
Now if you don't like these rules,
are universal, of course --
has been to collaborate with international cartoonists,
Not that I'm not afraid now,
My work also has allowed me to collaborate
that were sort of shadowy --
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
Now my mother was different.
that we can change this thing
in the middle of a lot of chaos.
to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s,
and not have to perform, not have to speak --
and we were supposed to fit into roles
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,
I was afraid of womanhood.
Now I started drawing
through not only the intellect, but through the heart.
even though we are imprinted at birth
I still think like an American woman.
in some very difficult circumstances.
telling us how to be.
And I think, I truly believe,
I could draw, do what I wanted to do,
so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons
so it puts us in a very tenuous position.
-- and how to do our hair --
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
and I could feel like I fit in.
We have amazing antennae.
We pass it down from generation to generation.
we can bring a different voice to the table.
And not only that, it can get to the viewer
and pretty and gentle and soft,
we don't perform them right,
and I drew to try to bring my family together --
Even though I've traveled a lot,
to be change-agents.
I always loved political cartoons,
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard
bombarding us with images and words,
I didn't have to wear pink,
and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,
because we are the carriers of the tradition.
and we know the traditions so well,
little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful
but we don't always know --
We don't know what's going on half the time,
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.
"Well, why don't I do something?
to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
And then also my family was in chaos,
I can't help it. I live here.
and talked and shared our difficulties.
and of course, the ever-present media
We're told what to wear --
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels,
that we can have the great potential
Because women are on the ground floor,
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up,
what better way than to change them [than] with humor?
Consequently, we have.
and the primary policemen are women,
we don't always know. We know there are rules out there,
trying to figure out what was going on.
-- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.
and we have sat together and laughed
But I found my place.
And I just ate it up.
I think you can get change.
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking,
that we do here in the U.S.
you get these beautiful natural forms.
And one of them said, "Come here. I think I can help you out here."
We've also been working in design.
And if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,
Now, mathematicians thought this was very strange
It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.
and we talked about fractals.
But that turns out not to be true.
you see very different uses for fractals.
so the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one,
And finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.
that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.
it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal.
So some of these things, I'd wander around the streets of Dakar
I realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this,
And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city
we can use any seed shape we like.
In Ethiopian crosses, you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape.
And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian, all strictly linear.
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found
And if you don't think that capitalism, which is self-organizing, can have destructive effects,
You can see on the pottery and the baskets.
I couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols.
George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra,
you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively.
and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back
Once again, infinity is important.
First of all, I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book, "The Invention of Africa,"
and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set.
They were breathing those words with fractal lungs.
And they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside
so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word --
This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390.
So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work,
They said these are pathological curves, and we don't have to discuss them.
This is in the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek.
And you can see, you go inside the family enclosure --
it's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.
that the farther up from the ground you go, the stronger the wind blows."
Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even.
in comparison with a control group that did not have the software.
It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine.
Now, after I did the simulation,
what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools.
we're very excited about the future possibilities for that.
and then four, and then 16, and so on.
It's the same pattern at many different scales.
But he was really cool about it, and he took me up there,
that sort of hierarchy, must have a kind of bottom-up architecture."
But they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system,
and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.
Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.
Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice
So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling;
they only did the randomness four times --
Right? Ones and zeros, the binary code.
And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape;
You get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns,
which is a great job if you can get it.
And three times, the answer is no.
So in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry.
Self-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast.
a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here,
so they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other --
He said, "Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw
and often the symbols are very well preserved,

recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools,
that are gentle, that are egalitarian.
he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory
So here's a Nankani village in Mali.
"Now," he said, "we know from experience
Odd plus even gives you odd.
as we heard earlier, it's in the brain.
Anywhere you go in the Sahel, you'll see this windscreen.
you can actually implement this in hardware --
So he starts out with one line, and then two,
the part looks like the whole.
The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes?
it doesn't quite fit.
so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.
Nature uses self-organizing systems.
So it's just like Georg Cantor said, the recursion continues forever.
Well, it's true that some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition.
It's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it;
and I couldn't understand where they were getting --
And so he came up with this beautiful curve.
you get the shapes of nature.
asking people why they were building fractals,
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.
And I started explaining why I was there in Africa,
but you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno.
It's also in some bad things.
"I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."
and then here's the village as a whole --
I said, "Can you take me to the square building?
And finally, the fractals have self-similarity --
and you can never go over the same line twice.
And his answer was very interesting.
And when he came out of the sanitarium,
This made no sense at all,
So even plus odd gives you odd.
Let's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth.
where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity.
Here's a wonderful fractal.
in the wind engineering handbook.
Now, because it's a binary code,
So these all have the property of self-similarity:
Your body is covered with fractals.
I thought, "Wow, so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society,
But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand,
These are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship --
So nature has this self-similar structure.
And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.
So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.
let's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two."
"Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?"
We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this;
So, when I got to the village,
you can never lift your stylus from the surface
"How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is."
"You know, I didn't learn it this way."
And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.
It wasn't invented until the 1970s.
And they did this very rapidly,
We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class
The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back,
I came up with this structure here.
And when she dies, they have a ceremony
Second, you might ask,
In some cases, there would actually be algorithms, and very sophisticated algorithms.
So this is very conscious knowledge.
"Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877."
the ethical power of democracy.
and my French is not very good; I said something like,
with the humans here where the sacred altar would be,
When I first saw those African fractals,
and it definitely is not "in the DNA."
You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast,
The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program
because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village,
And this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium. (Laughter)
But it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight."
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization,
decided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.
And finally, out of desperation, I said,
and then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right?
and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.
we now call it an Eulerian path --
so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going,
And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy:
These are robust algorithms.
And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?
You learn the next level of knowledge.
and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.
It's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship,
realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals,
You have a huge ring.
Now, the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul.
and would use them strategically.
It's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer.
They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.
And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers,
We've started a pilot program in Ghana.
And that was actually my original hypothesis.
Anybody in the world can use them.
and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.
Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry, right?
And he said, "Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes,
in which he's used some of these fractal structures.
A Swedish mathematician, von Koch,
So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year
But sometimes, that's not the case.
and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height
but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief,
here's the house of houses, the family enclosure,
this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him,
And the same divination system is found all over Africa.
And of course, I was only interested in the math,
the traditional African methods for doing self-organization.
as the ruler shrinks down to infinity, the length goes to infinity.
So here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on.
were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this.
you learn the iterations of the myth.
and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke,
When you have a four-bit symbol, you then put it together with another one sideways.
and they're stacked recursively.
It is not the same pattern at two different scales.
And they wouldn't tell me.
They said, "It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter."
so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols.
It's in ecological sustainability.
-- and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle,
Well, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at.
and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph;
the applets are all free; they just run in the browser.
So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.
That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors.
And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use.
It's not really mathematical knowledge.
Now, the tight rows up at the very top, they really hold out the wind and dust.
We've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino.
And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.
And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why.
And the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns
put it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent,
every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa.
and now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure.
No, because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture --
So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things,
for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure,
And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times,
And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility
The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.
So I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.
"Well, we just make it that way because it looks pretty, stupid." (Laughter)
and I'll come each day and pay you."
that it's not just about singing and dancing.
And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,
go ahead and do that now --
just to see how it would sort of unfold --
Here's one house with the sacred altar,
Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture?
and this was Bamana sand divination.
And you can go to our website,
And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle,
only the African ones were fractal.
Here's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins;
And with each iteration of that algorithm,
He said, "but wind and dust goes through pretty easily.
talked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria."
He was a mathematician on a mission.
And then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician,
And I measured out the lengths of straw,
So here's a little fractal model for it.
and then oppositional movements.
In the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain.
So we need to think about, as was spoken earlier,
each of which has an infinite number of points in it.
And finally, well, isn't this just intuition?
And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.
and create their own simulations and their own artifacts.
He was a very religious man.
This is a village in southern Zambia.
and I thought, "Wow! What a beautiful fractal!"
Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us,
And I said, "Well look, I'll pay you, you can be my teacher,
And then you take this symbol, and you put it back in
So all these little PDAs and laptops --
is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.
with a mathematician named Georg Cantor.

At any rate, I bring it up because it's a good story,
is that -- if the -- if there's too much CO2 in the atmosphere,

But nobody actually demonstrated it, right?
I'll stand up too, and --
and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it,
Remember, that's a short time.
You know, that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us.

if it's the greenhouse effect.
I said, what kind of salts of potassium do you have? You know.
because it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes, and --
how you were supposed to do science,

and then instead of, like, looking up,
I got this little book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma --
It isn't true. I mean, there's a lot of people --
we ought to invest in this shit,
And those two papers came out in Science Magazine,
You have to figure out what all those words mean.
There is a lot -- a lot has been going on since

And the English set up Cromwell

And if you start a grant request with something like that,
I used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised,
I mean, the way I would have done this would be, like, a rubber band,
because you weren't going to be talking final causes.
I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
I, like, for instance, I had this --
But I wasn't worried, by the way,
But you do it, by -- what I just--

You know -- and there is a lot --

In fact, everybody in this room probably,
And then you figure out better and better ways to do it.
There isn't a problem with global warming any longer,

So the theory's kaput -- it's nothing.
I do that on the weekend. And like --
that's what you call a lead.

like something that's warm gives off infra-red.
they didn't really understand the same way we do

and do ridiculous things with test tube.
like the actual evidence, you know,
You know, I started off with little tiny amounts

and the place didn't get warmer.
But that's not my job. I'm not into that.
Science had been all interlocked

That wasn't an explicit rule in the meeting,

and out of that came a lot of scientists

Now, Boyle was a friend of Charles II.
they had to do it on stage, where everybody could see it.

So the planet is a pretty amazing thing, you know,
Charles said, I'm going to put up the money
And so I -- I did some experiments.
and that it had been invented
the one fan would no longer turn the other one, right?
His name was Sven Arrhenius. He was Swedish, and he said,
you know, you call it Godless.
but it was also what -- it was an amazing thing that happened.

actually, he didn't think of it that way.
I mean, you want to call it Godless,
But in the actual process, you get an idea --
and in fact, the temperature hadn't really gone up.
we make one of these things.
And they got involved in it, and the scientific
descriptions of these papers, for, you know,
which was kind of a new word at the time,

I was thinking about making my own little rockets.

And it was -- I was following all the rules.
and as sure as hell afterwards,
that they can envision it, right? I mean --
there's obviously some mechanisms going on

And I said, that might do the same thing, whatever it is.

he got into trouble with the local clergy

you'll be misinformed, and you'll be worrying about the wrong things.
in that same time period before,
They changed the government, and it didn't work.
And he had potassium nitrate.
but a lot of other people later on

I -- sometimes you do that,
the sun puts out a certain amount of energy --
And then you slowly build up a theory
working in the places is going to have a dominant position,
and these -- the conclusion in both of these papers,
and all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight
about all the really important people that made advances, you know.
And then it cooled down to a brick-hard substance,
One of the things that happened right around World War II

And no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean, it's all --
every authority that you've ever heard of
But what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there,
You know, I was one of those scientists that was --
you make observations, you know.
you can almost read about their lives,
It's not by a small one. They just --
we don't want the -- we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so --
but if you picked up your bag, everybody in this room
by doing experiments: things that you could do on a stage.
and say, global warming obviously hadn't happened...
and if there was any puffs of smoke out there,
So the planet should get warmer.
and you can write these large reports, and you can get government money to do it,
so you can see what's going on inside this thing.
and they didn't have any football games to watch.
you looked like a gentleman, and they'd let anybody could come.
And then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid, brown.
where people don't get so -- you know,
some of you, I know, didn't pick up your bags --
I mean, it just -- it just -- untangled a thing that was really impeding
And she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on,

that was one of their rules, is God is everywhere.
I mean, the temperature has been measured now
I mean, you can talk about that stuff,
they didn't call it a vacuum pump at the time.

Well, these guys measured all of those things.

So if somebody could see it, you could say, here's how the machine works,
I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way.

So you still get heated, but you don't dissipate any.
You want to be rich, you be a businessman.
you know what a bell jar is? One of these things,
and setting up experiments. I thought that was the way everybody had always thought.
and some scientists at Columbia, and Viliki
then you have to get down the details, and read the papers called,
were starting to talk about, you know,
that kings would have definitely gone to war to get.
And, it smelt like burnt candy.
it was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up.
and he said, this will be cool,
And I started living down there on the beach for a long time.
At any rate, when I was a boy,
and that was that they did what they call a radiation --
They made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bomb
but people in the 17th century in England
I mean, individuals own things
But in fact, it was just coming up --
they have to say, what this means is, that what we've been thinking,
started not liking that.
the place has just undergone a lot of changes.
to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals.
And so he came up with this theory,
That -- you know, I was born thinking about things that way,
sort of loosely attached, so it could spin by itself.
And the religious people said that
a whole bunch of scientific public issues,
this is kind of -- it's hard to believe,
And there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society,

a lot of really interesting things.
It burned kind of slow, but it made a nice smell,
I've got another five minutes, right?
350 short years ago.
with no stuff in it, really,
But if we did, in 2025 or something,
you could only really talk about things in that place
how we're going to -- how we're going to continually prove
and people didn't know much about air.
I mean, we weren't frightened by it.
if you made this thing -- he made this little device,
You know, they made drugs to give the pilots
And there's a lot of things like global warming,
in, like, bars and stuff
this is about the time that Isaac Newton was starting to whip out
So I'm going to talk a little bit about that,
in the -- you know, the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff.
that I know that's DNA, and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify,
I -- you know, when I -- after I had invented PCR,
maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles.
I mean, fish don't know much about water,
therefore, probably sparklers wouldn't either.
But I -- it took me about -- it took me about,
that conversations that got going
Just to see what would happen, if you mixed it together.
and that sort of leads to that kind of science.
and both of these fairly professional --
I thought, was really fascinating.

and we can apply the special sauce: the translation.
And when they do all of that for about five years,
That's a tall order. We have to work at it.
But we don't have the words yet, so we add a third technology.
Teaching surgery and doing surgery
and maybe 20 million of these worldwide.
And I think that we can develop some tools to do so.
Surgeons are not made either.
So I was inspired by a friend.
engineering, law, conferencing, translating videos.
SS: So that's what we're working on
and out it comes in real time in Spanish.
We need it for our everyday life,
I work at the Cambridge Hospital.
to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator.
We have a lot to learn.
And it has to be bi-directional.
We build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room
Now that foundation is so important
to become something useful.
So I want to talk to you about two things tonight.
It's really about setting up a dialogue.
SAGES does surgery all over the world, teaching and educating surgeons.
and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital.
how doing and teaching this type of surgery
it's knowledge and skills.
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain.
And in my little corner of the world,
necessary to do minimally invasive surgery.
I need to have a health care lexicon.
This is the real thing. There's no blood.
And you can see how focused the surgeons are,
That's what I want to talk to you about tonight --
these basic fundamental skills
but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery.
But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time,
And you have no idea how hard it is
We can't travel everywhere.
We do about five million of these in the United States
You can see it in their faces.
"We want this, but we need it in our language."
and you can go out into practice.
before they do minimally invasive surgery.
you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian --
what you really want is a minimally invasive operation.
And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada?
using a framework of captioning technology,
So we're going to take it one step further;
At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors
So here's what we think we want to do:
It's a big labor-intensive effort.
that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school,
to demand that people work on translation.
But that's the lectures.
that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery
how much concentration it takes.
Narrator: Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery.
They have to be able to teach us something as well.
Now, this type of surgery is hard,
And one of the tools I like personally is using video.
It's not a lecture, it's not a course,
So we have a problem, and one of the problems is distance.
Who here has had surgery?
not just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients --
And everywhere I go the barrier is:
Aim for the black dots.
Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon?
You get your board certificate,
that you could actually teach people to do surgery
If you need surgery, you want to be operated on
for a better universal translator.
It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility.
We're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center
So let me show you what we're doing.
is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.
in order for a young surgeon to become board certified.
There are no little tanks where we're making surgeons.
it's an English test.
And there isn't always a translator available.
All right, you've all heard the term:
This past year I've been in Latin America, I've been in China,
you click the "I want it in Spanish" button
that cause a lot of pain,
So this is gallbladder surgery.
where they learn to be an assistant.
I want to talk to the people in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe
Let me tell you, surgeons are not born.
we then add another technology to do video conferencing.
to people who just got here last week.
sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen --
that all surgeons should be FLS (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery)-certified
something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world.
Because for them it's not a surgery test,
Even people who say they speak English,
there aren't enough translators in the world.
Your webpage has translation, your cellphone has translation,
So we looked for a universal translator; I thought there would be one out there.

Now, nobody wants an operation.
We work with a fourth technology.
It's hard to teach, and it's not all that easy to learn.
Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week.
by a board-certified surgeon.
between doing something successfully and not
and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen.
We want it to be bi-directional.
It's important to be accurate.
And I'd like to show you our prototype
for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.
only 14 percent pass.
In order to break down our barriers,
Now go ahead and cut.
We need to make the world a smaller place.
But if you have to have an operation,
We need a universal translator.
So let's see what it looks like.
it's dangerous stuff --
If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning,
We have a need to learn as well as to teach.
that separate us all over the world.
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation.
But for this examination, which is really hard,
It starts with a foundation, basic skills.
We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest.
on and on and on, simultaneously without the use of human translators.
As we think about intersecting technologies --
Nobody wants an operation.
using video conferencing.
So I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world.
to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to.
and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously.
of trying to talk to your patients --
in order to make the world a smaller place.
in our quest for the universal translator.
we could use this everywhere,
of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other
Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,
Now, it goes down to A.
All right. So I'm going to take a piece of Chopin.
what do we expect next?
-- and maybe a little bit of a march from "Aida"
to realize whatever he's dreaming.
for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading
and for human beings.
Now, the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you.
But basically, it's just a B, with four sads.
Now, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E,
My estimation is that probably 45 of you
and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing,
Because for me, to join the B to the E,
The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.

And the 11-year-old, one impulse on the whole phrase.

Within that context, we feel it's okay.

But really, it makes me —

is what's called bisociation.
Now, in fact, within a context of this book,
and when you actually look at that,
Paul Noth. "He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel."
In each instance, the narrative gets switched.
You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference,
"Very impressive. I'd like to find 5,000 more like you."
Now these look like very different forms of humor
on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part
One of the things I'm pointing out is that
What is New Yorker humor?
incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed.
"I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorists win."
At a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 --
that requires you to think.
If we think it's completely wrong, we say, "That's not funny."
and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler,
Here I'm one person talking to you.
"T-Cell Army: Can the body's immune response

is really interesting.
we were going to laugh. We were going to breathe.
But like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.
"I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state."
There is no such thing as funny in and of itself.
"It sort of makes you stop and think, doesn't it."
and in that space, the cartoons are different.
and how the mood we're in determines the things we like
Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.
Now, I'm from New York,
You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh.
is incongruity, and incongruity, I've shown you,
He laughs. He is both in danger and safe,
most of you laughed at that.
Now that's a little puzzling, right? It doesn't quite come together.
to some of the discussions about constraints,
Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because
A hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.
(Video) Woman: (Laughs)
But for us, and for me, helping design the humor,
The great Sam Gross cartoon, this happened
We understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together.
"Excuse me — I think there's something wrong with this
very easy for people to get their nose out of joint.
Many of them fade away. Some of them stay.
which is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes

they will laugh at very, very little.
That's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there.
If we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.
The other thing The New Yorker plays around with
But they mostly are going to be rejected.
but some day you'll be old, unless you drop dead as I wish."
And now, when you look at New Yorker cartoons,
It's sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look,
It's called dispositional humor.
that the real conflict and all the fights between religion
It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting.
It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.

Finally, in 1980, I received the revered

This is another cartoon from "The Rejection Collection."
It's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful,

in The New Yorker," this humor is perfect.
"You'll get the virgins when we find your penis."
And so, this benign, that's true of "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"
I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them.
It's not always appropriate every time.
the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.
You want to be transgressed.
Now let's look at this cartoon.
If the different frames of reference don't come together
"Asshead. Please help"? God.
To people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.
it's both wrong and also okay at the same time.
Here are some, generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.
"The Rejection Collection" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor.
Humor does need a target.
from 1974 to 1977 I submitted 2,000 cartoons to The New Yorker,
So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon,
For God's sake no, a thousand times no.
"Ass-head. Please help."
Office worker: Got a ham and swiss on rye?BM: No.
"I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket."
"No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"
That part of the relationship went fine.
So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.
It's nice, I'm sure to be young and rude,
How many people know what this cartoon means?
there of -- " blah blah blah blah -- blur --
In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think
Nobody is much interested, and the frog dies.
when I'm at The New Yorker, and that's the danger
Like, this cartoon would puzzle many people.
Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor
And this is my most well-known cartoon.
So within this context, "Asshead. Please help"
So what is an idea drawing? An idea drawing is something
There's a concept about humor about it being
Office worker: Okay. Pastrami on sourdough?BM: No.
The humor reflects back on us.
So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker,
It's making a little bit fun of getting older,
is a friend makes fun of an enemy.
So I'm a humor analyst, you would say.
That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year
you have to see, where is that tiger going to be?
Definitely no. [Several hours after lunch]
This guy. Who is he? He's the critic.
and, you know, people might like it.
our foils and our foibles, really not someone else's.
Basically, that's the way humor works.
There you have an interesting -- the guilty laugh,
"Lassie! Get help!!"
where we mash up these two things which don't go together
Oooh. Hmm. Too funny.
And one of the things that you realize
The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.
is sort of the basis of humor.
"The Rejection Collection" is absolutely in this field.
It's even on thongs,
The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment,
[Hey! You sold one. No shit! You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.]
Drawn just right, still not funny enough.
Different frames of reference.
and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor
but let's look what online survey I did.
When we're in a playful mood, we want excitement.
if we removed the articles.
and the vulgarity of the language.
so it's 100 percent satisfaction here.
"You slept with her, didn't you?"
But interestingly, in The New Yorker, the target is us.
is who has the best imaginary friend.
And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here
How are you going to manage it?
So it focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism,
Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of

to make it into a cartoon.
Now of course that's not what happened,
But this is a worse one.
And if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay?
One way to look at it is this.
The bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right?
but I think they will for you here.
Of course, many, many cartoons must be rejected.
It's called French Army Knife.
It's like this, like an amusement park.
The target is the readership and the people who do it.
What is it, the cartoon? Is it really about lemmings?
Hey, that's good, yeah, whatcha got there?
what you have is the syntax of politeness
"I'm thinking about having a child."
Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week.
That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do.
It's a very politically correct zoo, but it's a bad zoo.
in about .5 seconds, it's not funny,
The easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate,
Here's one of his cartoons.

We want high arousal. We feel excited then.
The first week we did no cartoons.
My job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week.
Bob Mankoff: That's my first wife.

That's a cartoon about terrorism.
But the next week, this was the first cartoon.

If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough,
because when I quit -- actually, I was booted out of -- psychology school
and I think this sums up the whole thing, really,
and something about us. Here's another one.
It basically was about, if we were alive,
but that's the emotional truth.
And so The New Yorker is also trying to, in some way,
enjoy more abstract art,
New Yorker contract,
I'm going to explain why.
No. Get out of here.
Everything will be within the context and our expectations.
This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog.

The New Yorker occupies a very different space.

"Discouraging data on the antidepressant."
Now E.B. White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.

That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor

is the word "cartoon" mentioned.
(Video) Bob Mankoff: "Oooh, no.
Thank you. (Applause)
and the message of being rude.
The word "idea drawings," and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons.
and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at,
some cognitive work on your part,
"I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me."
The humor is self-reflective
It's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists.
and we have 1,000 cartoons.

Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did
Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling.
There are the people, fops up there,
Where is the danger going to exist?
"My boss is always telling me what to do." Okay?
and makes us think about our assumptions.
and got 2,000 cartoons rejected by The New Yorker.
so many that there are many books called "The Rejection Collection."
Office worker: Smoked turkey with bacon?BM: No.
There's an incongruity and a contrast.
That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy
and really I'm forced to be in that position,
Other people thought it was funny.
Let's look at this cartoon.
Matt Diffee is one of them.
"There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just."
This is What Lemmings Believe.
That was a black hole for humor, and correctly so.
So there the violation is malign. It doesn't work.
In each instance, our expectations are defied.
Let's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture,
"Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit.
And of course, that is not New Yorker humor.
In here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker

Now, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine
Well, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons.
It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.
Here's another cartoon.

but the whole physical environment becomes this person.
are proof that if you make the right kind of interface,
and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color
you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror,
Everybody can experience music in a profound way,
you can see it also, you can see where the sections are,
very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.
that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero],
people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?
around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.
So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles
The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically,
This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it,
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?
extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?
but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music,
but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance,
Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.
has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way,
touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.
to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.
all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.
he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.
we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince,
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones,
But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted
wonderful instruments like that for everybody,
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.
"Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.
each string is controlled with a little robotic element --
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies --
the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic
and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab
who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing --
one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.
They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now
mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to
to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know,
the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years --
We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids
and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.
but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.
where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital
but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world
This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital,
I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words,
Guitar Hero came out of our lab,
This is a sneak preview.
When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make
It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.
Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.
Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan. (Applause)
use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound,
called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive,
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms,
which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared,
one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.
He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.
And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers --
and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends,
Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera,
for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.
draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore,
to make music in something like Guitar Hero.
so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called
as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives
was stretched at that point to fit just Dan.
But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly
that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area --
we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect --
movement to people with Parkinson's disease.
be able easily to make his own pieces,
TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.
Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.
If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you,
So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings,
did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out
And that led to something which you probably do know.
and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship
that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise,
or into something that nobody has ever heard before.
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera
But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part,
we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it,
So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music,
We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project
we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.
it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform
So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now,
not just listening, but making music?
Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm,
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.
Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window,
because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage,
my own music with this new software.
at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.
strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.
but it's actually a robotic music instrument.
and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls,
thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today
where we built a museum around it.
So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called
a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.
basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know,
it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on
It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces,
So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology
So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.
It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements,
So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?
He can place those exactly where he wants.
So, are we ready Adam?
I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra,
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes,
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.
And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.
What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan
in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.
TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone
So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says,
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.
to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience,
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.
from ourselves to the outside world.
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers,
thinking of as personal opera.
So, the process and the technology --
that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?
Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement,
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg,
to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples
like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier,
when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic,
important to control and convey in a piece of music?
DE: This is "My Eagle Song."
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.
We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna,
like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers,
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.
And so that's what we'll do today.
It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments,
who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.
One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.
of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although
Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound,

completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.
to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.
and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.
to experiment with it, to make their own music.
Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma
So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling,
you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button,

not to bump into each other. They go off on their own.
I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.

up with a big bang at the end.
the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.
through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.
What types of things does he find
incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.
of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have,
to be able to perform his piece of music.
But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers
and playing it over and over and over again.
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct
it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying
in a much broader context, for all kinds of people
So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago,
In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece,
And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.
we've been engaged in a field called active music.
how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments,
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.
And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?
because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what
love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.
So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment,
technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.
And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.
I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument,
the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan,

So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.

that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that
They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope,
to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know,
It can change the way you communicate with others,
The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books.
another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacy
following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive
You know, what's his metaphor for performance?
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most
I'm actually going to share something with you
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well --
they realized that they needed to put the resources together,
And somebody donated tennis shoes for me.
and how things smell.
While I was preparing my dog for the run,
And in fact, they started to call me a Gomer.
once my hair grew back.
and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.
And I ended up with a plastic nose, porcelain teeth
The one advantage that they had over most of you

and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma.
and my new teeth and my lips,
and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado.
that landed you in this situation.
And I remember putting my hands on the ground
Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck
and then he ran over my legs.
I was wearing hospital scrubs.
was actually learning to cross a street again
my life was going to change forever.
so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth.
what to do with people like that.
and they were going, "Okay, what skills do we have in this room?
since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest
So they figured not being able to see is one thing,
So I moved on from there.
So one of the seniors just came up to me,
The biggest change for me
I was wrapped in ice
gave me pots and pans, blankets,
my new throat with my tongue
that went whizzing across the road,
and how things sound
We're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me
and you had a horrible accident
to try to get my feet moving the right way.
that these seniors had.
I thought that time had stood still for some reason
and through my veins.
I flew out in front of the car,
I had more than 50 surgeries.
people working with people to rebuild me;
I had no idea that at that moment
The hospital really has no idea
So they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart,
because of the senior citizens who invested in me,
is feeling like a grenade went off in my head.
and they were trying to put a beat back into it.
how to eat like a normal human being,
and I had to learn how to coordinate
But by the third cane
and all gathered their extra furniture --
Somehow I ended up at the hospital.
One of the pivotal times for me
It's your major artery, and it was severed,
So they pulled back and they were looking at each other,
So there were all these skills and talents

and is replaced with how you feel about things
But the concept held true --
and you hear cars whizzing back and forth,
And I was able to return to college
"Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."
and the only thing that I actually remember
I say moving because it was quivering
I needed to figure out
They removed a hematoma from behind my eye.
She ended up underneath the car.
So they went to their storage lockers
and went for my usual run.
Your aorta comes up behind your heart.
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover.
So they were teaching me cuss word Scrabble at night,
I had lots of titanium put in me,
that's what a senior home has.
So you can't be an independent person
when Sally finally got my confidence built.

At that point, I had gained four pounds,

And I touched it and I went,
I was running across the street,
was assess what I needed right away.
It was actually robotic surgery.
But it's hard sometimes to talk about these things,
that they needed to have an emergency meeting.
They were going to make it fun for me.

Some things worked, some things didn't.

You learn things unconsciously.
I ended up with blunt chest trauma.
from whatever they were going through.
I came home from work, put a leash on my dog
and also to go get a guide dog
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it."
all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now,
But one of the first things they needed to do
is they decided that, well I need to learn to speak.
and one of them was experimental.
The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands
when I showed up at their doorstep?
and in came the polyester and floral prints.
to repair my heart a few times.
as to what my first words were
to stop that catastrophic event from happening.
"Well she needs furniture.
you take things for granted.
We didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration
When I was 22 years old,
and I couldn't walk.
And so the senior citizens realized
But the men had a better idea.
to be a blind person,
So I was walking around it.
but strangers intervened,
But if you think about
But imagine what it was like for them
So we'll just keep moving on.
all these things that I had never seen before.
So out went the green scrubs
You don't know how far that street is
So eventually what went on
And every time I approached the corner or the curb
I opted in for three surgeries,
you have the tactile memory for things.
And then they had to figure out:
it's hard, because when you're a kid,
so I got going on it.
as I take you through this journey.
I was blind, I couldn't speak,
for somebody else that they thought could come back
and refused to work.
and I thought it was a monster.
picked up his car keys, got into a car
I had no idea what was going on,
I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together,
matching their talents and skills
so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well
And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life.
The redundancy was actually good for me.
If it's hit, don't cross the street."
cellphones, laptops,
The bumper of the car hit my throat,
and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand.
Now imagine you have to cross a street.
"A senior citizens' home? What in the world are you going to do there?"
So I'm going to just leave it to your imagination
But when you're blind,
And they went through that process.
was teaching me to speak in the day --
and that I needed to get caught up,
They needed to open up space
So I acted like a two-year-old
so that I could go to the Braille Institute
and I saw this thing sitting in my room
So they eventually started
One was post-traumatic stress disorder.
And my lung collapsed,
and all kinds of new things --
And I know all of you are scratching your head:
10 years later I gained my sight back.
because you take that for granted.
But eventually I started to look human again.
because they had a long life.
"When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there.
I realized that time marched on for me too
18 months later I woke up.
it was time for me to go.
And I had a white cane in one hand
And then the next thing that I needed
So one day I was in my room
if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration.
a man was finishing drinking at a bar,
and horrible things were happening to me.
That's another story we won't even get into.
how to swear like a sailor.
and feeling my life's blood
So I had to go through trying to eat again.
So while Sally, the office manager,
took on the task of teaching me to write.
and she pushed me up to the corner and she said,
I haven't talked about probably in more than 10 years.
and capture the air and get the word out.
This kid needs a lot of work."
But I did say no to the blue hair.
So there were two obstacles I had to get through.
when you're a sighted person
to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there.
and all kinds of other things.
But when I looked down,
I wouldn't be standing here today
but they need to get me to talk.
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
"united nations" are supposed to mean:
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --
down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.
we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,
It is a very geologically active body.
and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,
and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,

and search for answers to questions like this,
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.

And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,
then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.

And then, only a week and a half ago,
about seeing ourselves from afar,
and it also took panoramic pictures.
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,
you see the refracted image of the Sun
that we had remaining in our solar system.
and now humans had actually touched it.
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:
and have been for the past two and a half years.
but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,
and sadly, that wasn't the case.
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.
for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,
And we have taken pictures like this.
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.
And we have arrived at the conclusion
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --
Now, there is something deeply moving
or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan
and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to
and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
It was a moving demonstration of what the words
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.

extending hundreds of miles into space.
you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
And it's probably the case that this material
and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,

And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --
But we couldn't make sense of our images,
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,
since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space

it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.

It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
more like the environment we have here on the Earth,
it might be raining, and you might be standing
with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,

It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system
And in this impossibly beautiful picture,

In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,

And so it's been tectonically altered.

Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,
it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered

for a much larger human voyage
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,
But these haze particles, it was surmised,
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers
I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,

especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things
It is so significant that, in my mind,
you would be flying at these altitudes.
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.

But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,

And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,

So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,

They look like they've been pulled apart.
and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures
of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,

It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.

It was a tremendously emotional event,

It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,

So very simple things like that,
this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB -- get in there fast --
because it is illegal to trade any sharks.
And basically it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters.
So what they do is they store the data.
and even less money on some oven cleaners.
Now when we were out tagging our sharks,

But again, it's kind of surprising. You wouldn't really expect that.
In fact, they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever,
you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar.
And about two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85,

And they actually did get a fine for that.
We tagged 105 sharks last summer.
You can only rarely be in the right place to find sharks into August.
its diversity is much greater.
It became known as Simon's shark slime.
We had no idea, did they distinguish into different populations?
So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat,
that went from the Isle of Man all the way out to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.
And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbor,

And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size:
They grow 10 meters long.
And it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck, a genetic bottleneck
And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime.
There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted
you can see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study,

they found that the diversity was incredibly low.

What happens is that you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period,

And yet, if you look at whale sharks,

It might be a change in the distribution of plankton.

There was no way we were going to get a sample from that.

So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,
I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.
and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article,
and I mean this honestly --
you'll be watching TV.
the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.

They know that when you watch T.V. at home,

We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq,

And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.

And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,

So, I've been really lucky as an inventor.

that's about 100,000 vibrations per second.
You turn up the volume just a little bit --
the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.
because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message
and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?
and the guy in the front row gets the same level
and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,
we can spread it out to cover the couch.
I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.
So, we create silence as much as we create sound.
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:
It also works for transmitting and communicating data.

Golly, I'm just totally losing it.

And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one
And now let's compare that with fish farming.
For example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught
global meat consumption has more than quadrupled,

that could make a real difference
and that's what we need to be working on together --
that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural,
Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming.
This challenge is staggering --
our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.

Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it.

And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently.

Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.
In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption.

And that solution lies in aquaculture --
People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust

We really need a transparent food system that we can trust,
and we don't know what pollution it encounters.
and talk about why fish is the best food choice.
We can now farm far more species than ever before

we need to change our global food production systems.

where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture,
As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive,

we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution.

Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind,
And to talk about stats --
There's been excessive use of chemicals,

The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated
and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,
And the way she died -- she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.
and most of the times when I talk about it,
where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.
but they also have some disadvantages,
that they needed to be people of a certain age,
I said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"
It had nothing to do with their intellect,
one of the great phenomenal women of her day.
And he looked at me, you know, as if to say,
and then went back into the room and was never seen again.
and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.
Then there's the celebrity interview,
people taking good hours of the day to be with them.
Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,
and we had an extraordinary conversation.
So she and I had a delightful conversation.
but I want to tell you about questions
She was editor of Vanity Fair,
and she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?"
And so he filled the room,
you don't get it on the stage.
Now, these are arm wrestle questions,
Who makes a great interview in this context?
and she walked around and talked to every person there
I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,
and he was this courtly fellow.
and caginess on the part of the interviewee.
There's nothing that ever happens that justifies
That's the one advantage that older people have.
And I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did."
And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.
but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,
I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.
And we had a conversation,
and we want to deliver them to future generations.
But then I began to think of other things.
Again, a remarkable person.
She was the New Englander and abrasive,
and particularly the older members of your family.
This is somewhat against resistance
"Aw, shucks, it was an accident."
because then her looks didn't matter.
how the story turned out.
it's created to look at American lives.
and they're amazing people,
is what's critical to this kind of interview.
it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.
to break out of their own cocoon of the public self,
The public self, the beauty, the intellect,
Just be that way with your friends
to how do you get through all the barriers we have.
which are the interrogation that is expected.
to listen to them, and they sit there and they say,
although she did dance for a while, a choreographer
and she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"
"Would you like to have met him?"
for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.
but this was a woman in great physical distress.
or empathy, at any rate,
She did an extraordinary play called "The Women."
and we had an hour conversation about his life,
There are the journalist interviews,
she said, "Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.
He said, "You know, I've read everything,
I didn't know who she was,
and by the way, at one point I asked him,
and she turned to the audience and
was George Abbott, who was 97,
and so we got up on the stage,
I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,
and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.
and he and she had exactly the relationship
and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.
There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.
it hadn't been offered to her, was her life.
the more convinced I am that that's true.
In fact, the first person I interviewed
because I always have preliminary talks with these people
So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,
And she was sitting there surrounded by books,
he thought it was worth a chance,
At the time that I proposed to her that --
and that they want to share it with you.
and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,
But he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so."
First of all, was that dance, even though
very gruff voice, from a woman.
Now, I had two preconditions.
These were people through their 90s.
And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,
Half of her body was stricken, the other half not.
and almost toward the beginning of the interview,
And I thought it was worth a chance,
They have to think that they did something
But the second part of it -- and the older I get,
But after the interview, I got a call,
Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,
as to whether her name means much to you.
The usual sort of thing.
transforming the American theater.
which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say
And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,
which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.
Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes.
And she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,
creating the life narrative that we inherited.
The worst interviews that you can ever have
to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.
so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.
he was speaking complete sentences on his own."
I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.
and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.
She basically created the dances in "Oklahoma,"
and he said, "Well ..." -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,
I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.
There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.
but it was a little surprising for the person involved.
we know what we're not going to share,
Didn't matter." Whatever.
And I said, "I'm learning."
that they have a story worth sharing.
and connecting with him,
for whom all the ballet lessons were given.
And I thought really what we need is an elders program
of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,
It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews
And so she spent almost all of her life in bed,
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.
Just withering in her contempt.
Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.
and they felt that this was a kind of assault,
as to give you this whole notion
And, in fact, when we did the interview --
and I said, "My father was loving and supportive,
and that was some 10 years before.
They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?"
The key point was empathy
but you really want them also to think
She was 80, almost that day of the interview,
the great hits of that program,
I had known that she had had a stroke,
and we all have infomercials about our lives.
He said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface,
if we've got an interviewer who gets that,
For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.
but it was never about that.
It all has to do with that shell that most of us have,
is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,
So, we can then go back in our lives,
So, you know, you want energy,
And the audience just -- you know,
and I change it all the time
When he started a sentence, particularly
that happened in this interview series.
Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,
And the only reason I really know that
That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important
He said, "But I understand that." He said, "I understand that."
There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.
that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.
of amazing people who would come and I would interview.

I didn't know it coming into it.
That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,
The journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."
and I got up there," and she went on and on, "And then I got on the stage."
because he saw the letters.
And I asked him one question.
my being a brush in the hand
And she said, "Well, something very weird was happening.
And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,
people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,
That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.
And then she made me go up with the tape of it
and basically, I thought, I got it.
"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?"
She said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,
She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.
and then we'll decide whether we proceed."
and I could never do it."
and you think while you talk,
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do
that are more related to empathy
And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically
And I said, "I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that."
the more entrenched that person, that outer person was.
and she said, "Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.
And he basically was saying that this was a man
And I began to wonder what was going on,
So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.
and then she said, "And then puberty hit."
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.
and the more public they had been,
"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,
All of us are public and private beings,
I'm attracted to her.
But really the most important question I ever asked,
And she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,
because I got to read all of his letters."
and then I asked her this unthinkable question.
So, how do we do that?
She lived in New York.
Thank you very much.
But I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.
That was easy, but then I made the decision,
She said, "Come to my apartment."
This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,
with her red hair and her light steps and so forth,
We never talk before that because if you talk before,
What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?
She was a congresswoman
was her will, which she had by her side.
and after that a woman rushed up to me,
but proposed to her that she come on.
This was not an oral history program.
Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress."
and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit."

described herself as the fair demoiselle
and Abbott was filled with the life force --
by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary --
By the way, this was always done in public.
I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.

It's amazing what people will say when they know
in the moderate-to-full entertainment world
That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,
but then we were off and running.
that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,
and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment
of what her life really was like.
because all of these people have been assembled
and I was basically up there -- any of you
One was that they be American.
She was, of course, done up for the occasion,
I turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin,
and to be an agent of their self-revelation.
instead of saying, "Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,"
and she literally turned -- here she was, in this broken body --
and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,
I started to worry about the fact
She did so much. She was a playwright.
tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.
Then at a certain moment, the door opened
and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account
and how they became what they are,
what is it going to take to make this work?
spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,
His father was an SOB,
but I was so part of the process of getting that out.
She wasn't about to make up for this occasion.
Mike Wallace's old interviews --
And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,
so that they can be truthful about who they are
are with people who are modest.
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.
and in that process, she made a number of decisions.
And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.
just enjoying her presence.
She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.
I didn't know what was going on,
but it did affect his speaking and so forth.
This wasn't -- and some of you will remember
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.
He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,
and when people deliver and when they don't and why.
I'm convinced of it.

And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.
It'll be your generational determinant
but -- I speak of the life force --
This was not a devastating stroke,
And he said, "Now, John Adams was too honest."

I asked her a question about her days as a playwright,
And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.
Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.
wanted somebody to ask her whole life.
what you try to find out about them,
and extraordinary lives.
there were three former directors of the CIA
I'm going to talk about a program I started there,
And he had never appeared in public since that point.
She stayed in her room.
All of those accidents that wound up
I didn't know how I was going to get out of it --
He subsequently got married again at 102,
and I just proceeded into the questions.
which is why I'm not funny."
I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,
so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation."
because everybody in their lives
and so then I asked her a question --
And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.
the bridge to get to the end of the sentence,
and particularly certain people.
and that was six months after he'd had a stroke.
We know the great lines, we know the great moments,
And she was in horrible pain.
But I wanted interviews that were different.
and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.
and begin to reflect on how we got there.
by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.
One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.
It was about their energy.
And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.
and paused, you gave him the word,
This was to Agnes de Mille.
That's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson
And, in fact, he did wind up opening up --
they're always on the side of the interviewee,
the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.
And I said -- these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate --
just because I want to."
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.
as Nixon in that process.
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,
"And you know what those young actors did?
Now I'm her competitor for the audience.
and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one
except maybe a word or two.
She was in a great evening gown.
And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.
And so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you
She was sort of adored on the Right
And that's what it's about.
and she called out to me, and she was in bed.
It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,
and very few of us were invited to a dinner party.
but I promise you it was the right question.
And then she turned to me and said,
I said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?"
Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.
for never ever saying anything
you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,
and he said, "What was your childhood like?"
there's no point in it.
where we know how the story turned out.
and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.
When we were alone, I was her audience.
and how she could no longer count on her beauty,
And then he turned to me, not stupidly,
to presenting great American lives,
And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment
we've reached the point in life
to her body and her face,
which at that point, when I created this program,
because he was famous for being silent,
and that really, very often, are the questions
Some of them were very brilliant,
And, incidentally, I call her
Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.
The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.
It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,
who lied more than he wished he had,
It was an amazing privilege to do this series.
but the one thing they or we have is that
And she began to talk about things that had happened
the quality of their intellect.
What I'm going to try to do is explain to you
Now in order to work out what people are going to do
Two things to notice: he's getting weaker,
there's no history in here.
that Sally over here,
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.
and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate --
trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior,
between building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel
as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time,
Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad.
If they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision,
Just about nobody supports research on weapons-grade fuel today,
because it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways.

It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them.
You might notice what we don't need to know:
and engaged in the same sorts of calculations,
we would like to think, may have some influence --
'I don't know how to do it.'"
At 130, we start somewhere above 130,

they don't need to go to sleep at night,
Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him?
to what Khomeini had in mind.
and by the way, this was done a while ago
Imagine a problem with just five decision-makers.
or you are concerned to influence national security policy,
But let's face it, the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran.
If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States
of 87 decision makers in Iran,
you're confused with,
a direction contrary
who spend their lives studying places and problems,
of just looking at a few people.
by the late parts of 2010, early parts of 2011.
and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions,
beginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome.
"When you say 'That's impossible,'
because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction,
we need to look at this in a rigorous way.
With five decision-makers
or we can get it from asking experts
what they're after, what they value, what they want,
and we could get there a lot sooner,
So if you are concerned to influence energy policy,
who they think is going to know more about the particular problem.
It would be a good thing if
The yellow line shows us the most likely path.
you say back to them,
and schizophrenics are probably not rational,
they may be weak, they may be located in the wrong part of the world,
they can. They don't need coffee breaks,
Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran?
then we can engineer the future.
maybe the ambassador to the United Nations, or somebody else
they've also pondered that.
"That's impossible,"
they switch what they think all the time,
there are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction,
How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran?
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics,
and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers,
They're careerists, they also care about getting credit --
the Director of National Intelligence,
But if you show them that it's in their interest,
which is what they say is their objective.
is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known,
I haven't shown it all the way down to zero,
environment, energy,
And they face limitations, constraints,
and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying.
The Financial Times, The New York Times,
of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today,
or situations involving coercion --
There's a good reason that we don't do that,
we can work out what the choices are that people have,
BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want,
if they're not put under international pressure,
and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community,
but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position,
And down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy,
the power is all drifting out here,
Unfortunately, a lot of times we don't do that.
it's not just wisdom or guesswork.
maybe it's the Secretary of State,
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that,
as big an effect, as perhaps you would like it to have.
not what they think they can get,
and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world.

Again, whether we're talking health policy, education,
how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.
We've increased it to 3.6 million.
These are the Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom,
These guys are all shrinking,
Over here you can see this is the distribution
CA: So you're kind of trying to say, "People of Iran, this is your destiny, lets go there."
is because then we can reproduce what we're doing;
If we're talking about national security problems,
but you can see that the line comes down faster
And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have
I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of --
the predictions about the path of policy.
What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program?
We can get this information
of the decision-making pyramid.
How is this happening?
So it would be a good thing.
That's not going to be happening,
and these are the simulated dynamics,
these are what the Iranians call the quietists.
So where are we going to get this information?
cares about two things on any decision.
under its own domestic political pressures.
We need to know what they say they want,
And they have beliefs about what other people want,
That's this line here, growing in power,
what Harry is saying to these three,
Most people fall in between, and if we can work out where they fall
we need to use science.
I would like to leave you with one thought, which is
is, at least for me, not predictable,
Let me make three important predictions --
who are not well known to Americans.
I don't have a clue.
But Sally also wants to know
I remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate.
because I'm not engaged in the business of magic.
without having to manipulate them so much --
just panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that
you can get a better result.
Why should we believe what he's saying?"
Everything is not predictable: the stock market
and that a lot of others can live with.
people have values -- they identify what they want, and what they don't want.
Alright, lets turn to Iran.
with the exception of one group of mullahs,
we have to pay attention to everybody
I got very nervous halfway through the talk though,
with regard to producing pollutants,
And if you engineer what they do you can change the world,
Mother Theresa, she was rational.

And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.
and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.
And I also think it's dangerous,
Because in the end it's like this, OK --

about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.
incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God.
to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months
in one 18 minute speech.
the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately,
and I think it is true,
"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?"
I had this encounter recently
through your efforts, then "Olé!"
that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.
And we were talking about this,
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air
and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles,
And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript
If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment
for distant and unknowable reasons.
Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know --
kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing
That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!
And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.
I think it's odious.
And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation --
when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them
haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries
And what is it specifically about creative ventures
Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon

And I always have been.
who died young and often at their own hands, you know?
in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds
Why not think about it this way?
but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.
Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think
who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio,
the question becomes, what now?
when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid.
and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal
But then he got older, he got calmer,
that's exactly what my creative process is like.
I've been sort of looking across time,
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish
in my life and in my career,
that was not quite Tom.
you know, like the font and the essence and the source
who spoke wisdom to him from afar.
We writers, we kind of do have that reputation,
who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.
And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,
That's the kind of thought that could lead a person
Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,
who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide
If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it,
And when this happened, back then,
and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?
And there's probably people in this audience
centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa,
And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that
and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering
that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,
about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.
people treat me like I'm doomed.
And his whole work process changed after that.
even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
The result of which is that everywhere I go now,
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things,
and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia,
because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life,
But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently
They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals
and I've been trying to find other societies
Seriously -- doomed, doomed!
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.
So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.
from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life
if you never happened to believe, in the first place,
If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case
it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding
rather than having a genius.
Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
It just didn't come up like that, you know?
But the question that I kind of want to pose is --
Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer
is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this,
you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius,
was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him
people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.
and he wants it, it's gorgeous,
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself
for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers
Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life
But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought
to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have
So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about --
And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact
You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person
But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember
in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?

and who would come out

This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make

It just completely warps and distorts egos,

it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."

People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

Of course, I had no hair and no immune system.
May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,

Linda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.
And she loved the idea,
although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,
about sitting down with my closest friends
and that is everybody dies,
in the passages of my daughters' lives.
she reached for my crutches and handed them to me.

"I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out.
but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.
and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car --
And there was something incredibly profound
He said, "I would tell them what I know,
and ask them to be present
And as I lifted my leg out of bed,
and people surrounded with the ones they love.
we were tiptoeing through the dung
And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,

We should focus on the positive.

of how I might give them that voice.
even though we never did tip the cow,
because that's where love comes from."
And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit --
I can say this I guess because you've done it here --
And that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,
that you sort of "happy" your way through a problem.
A few days later, I woke with an idea
the glint that says, "Let's go cow tipping,"
into a much more horrifying negative.
I hosted a television show by that name
And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,
but it really changed us.
which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.
that I first saw back in Holland --
that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.
and was like, "Hmm, April 15th -- tax day.
And then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads
So if you approach them from behind, down wind,

And as he talked he had that glint in his eye
our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,
And when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.
He was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.
And because walking was one of the first things I lost,
wrote a series of books about my travels,
We were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.
I said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.

Tybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,
Instead, it was everybody running the other way.
I was like, "Cow tipping?
I traveled around the world, entered different cultures,
As I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living --
And this was the 1960s
was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday --
One day, my daughter Tybee,
"So, have you ever been cow tipping?"
In fact, I made a living by walking.
We thought our family would already be there.
And I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of --
what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.
and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.
in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.
I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.
one word that I've only heard once actually
the aisles I might not walk down.
When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46
And Jeff came up beside me and said,
we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.
And the first one was no family, only friends.
And this is what we wanted him to capture --
that intersected our neighborhood,
the third of which was, "Are you related?"
Then he took my fibula from my calf,
and my family moved to a new neighborhood
Now as soon as I had this idea,
And it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record --

and we came up with a number.

And this also happened to my girls as they began to see,
And this idea of pausing
although I must say, our favorite nickname
I said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge."
So we decided that we needed a set of rules,
you saw these enormous screws
Approach the cow, pack your flipflops,
it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.
I would call this group of men "the Council of Dads."
and was reunited with the ones I love.
is that you walk slower.
That sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.
So one day near the end of my journey,
with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.
can never find a solution for scan-xiety.
And if you did see the Sanjay special,
that Linda said, what we were talking about,
a few of which you've heard here today:
Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.
I planted the seeds for a healthier future
And what was so striking about that time
as I did for a year and a half --
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.
it became a sort of symbol to me.
what my wife really thought of my friends.
Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.
And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,
is this Council of Dads
and I listed these lessons,
Will you help be their dad?"
I was walking on air.
And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches --
that stands between you and one of your dreams.
and during the year and a half I was on crutches,
was a very efficient way to find out
In my case it's quarterly.
And that particularly happened -- there was one in my life --
that appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads,"
They may not have their dad.
I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma
I didn't need the crutch anymore,
laughing with all the glee in the world.
And it's become my own motto for my girls.
And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.

And my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,

So it turned out that starting a council of dads

I wrote a letter to my girls
but they may not have me.
Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed

So that afternoon, I went back to my house,

I sort of friend-married each of these guys.

So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.
He said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same,

Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.
to the progress of the human mind
About a week later we had a problem with the machine,
when the machine is working in full power.
and saw the front page was like that.
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.
the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --
there was a manufacturing defect.
there are no new worlds to conquer."
which is a great triumph.
Its job is to recreate the conditions
what the building blocks of the universe are.
So at minus 271 degrees,

And what the astrolabe does is it allows us,

In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses
How cool is that? This is just amazing.
Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge

They are just incredibly expensive.
And the mater has some scales and puts it all together.

Step four is I then move the rete,

So, affordances are the qualities of an object

And so, what can you learn from these devices?
so they fit perfectly.
Astrolabes have an incredible history.
So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.

is that they are beautiful works of art.
the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.

This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?
And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.
So, that's just one use. Incredible,
So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.
The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems

Well, let me first back up for a moment.

No one deserves that."
There are three things that I want to offer us today to think about
It's not the hardest thing to do,
I don't know why exactly I think that, but that's what I think.
We gotta get out of denial.
I'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are.
who have changed our lives and made them better.
You know, biases are the stories we make up about people
and stick it up next to a person of color,
If you ask me explicitly, I would say, "Female pilot: awesome."
I did the black guy thing. I'm a woman of color. Oh my God!"

Okay, so that's number one: number two,
awesome, hardworking laborers.
The other possibility in science,
We've got to be willing to say, "Grandma, we don't call people that anymore."
What are we going to do about it?
So in fact, what the scientists are telling us is, no way.
and they are young men with dreams of their own.
that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong.
Please, please, just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data
looking for a respite from all the brutality
by looking within and being willing to change ourselves.

When we see something, we have to have the courage to say something,

Now, here's the problem.
When we see a black face,
"Uncle Joe is racist."
So go away from your comfort into a bigger, brighter thing,
They're like, "Oh, Ms. Diversity Lady, we're so glad you're here" --
we are not being aware of the ways in which racial difference

We prefer white. What do I mean by that?
Let me just start with number one.

when we've been told to avoid and be afraid of them?
even to the people we love.
And I saw this person across the street, and I was thinking, "Oh great, black guy."
We still have in us this old stuff
because when we look at awesome folks who are black,
and it's often turbulent and bumpy,
that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you.
to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism
Fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white.

We need real people.

Because, you know what? Just look around your periphery.
There may be somebody at work, in your classroom,
These are people who are powerful preachers.
What do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates?
They are dynamic comedians.
And we wonder why these biases don't die, and move from generation to generation?
that I can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is,
You know that part of us that still crosses the street,
The problem was never that we saw color. It was what we did when we saw the color.
I believe that we can stop these types of incidents,

And I said, "You know what? Please. We really need to relax about this."

Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan,

You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive
So when we're talking about cutting government spending,

because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,

In the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.
I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.
And I want to give you just one more example,
And so if you do something with those systems,
whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?

and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,
But if it could occur in just a few years,
And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.
We're dealing with living systems;
the answer to the first question?
But there's another really interesting aspect of this,
But I'm not just doing this to be cute.
then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.
But, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,
there's a lot of them here, I can tell --
They're going to wash those contaminated materials,
But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,

Now, these ideas should apply across the board,

in the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."
They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile.
I mean, if this would require thousands of years,
about a third to half of them were infected with malaria.
Now, I don't know how that happened,
So, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,
for their own reproductive success.
there you expect these organisms to evolve
Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.
how can we take control of this situation once we understand
and that toxin is released when the organism
they'd be infected with mild strains.
And this was, incidentally, published in 1949,
And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.
But it doesn't tell you how long.
and we don't think we've got a problem here.
And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done
And a very closely related question, which is,
so that even though people might be getting infected,
caused the eradication of malaria.
cholera that's acquired endemically,
and we measured their toxin production in the lab.
you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.
And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.
that take advantage of those hosts,
In a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,
disease organisms have to get from one host to another,
It would make these organisms evolve to mildness,

Anyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.
So, if you were to mosquito proof houses,
To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that
But I think there's a really fascinating example

we should have a very powerful tool.
is that we understand why it's so harmful.
And that brings me to the title of the talk,
So, it's controlled.
just by cleaning up water supply.
of other individuals.
And in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.
that I've only talked about two examples.
And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,
and if it confirms the prediction, then
And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at
Now, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission,
on average, reported from Chile every two years.
They found in the late '30s -- 10 years after they'd made these dams --
And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.
A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds
of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.
So, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,
Some countries that might have clean water supplies,
Antibiotic sensitivity was going down.
So, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions.
they really mean design by natural selection.
And when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.
you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough
will be the milder organisms.
you might find a million diarrheal organisms.
And when evolutionary biologists talk about design,
The only pathogens that get transmitted
these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.
And you can show, just by looking at data from literature,
which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation
And if you took a drop of that water,
And that is the species of organism that is responsible
the design of diarrhea.
unlike the first two modes of transmission,
within a few days she was looking like a completely different person.
it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.
that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,
It's sort of cloudy water.
And once you get increased antibiotic resistance,
and may actually be very resistant, when one tries
Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was,
so that we can actually solve the problem,
in a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.
because if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.
And when they're transmitted through the water,
She got rehydration therapy, she perked up,
but I did want to put them up there,
And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea
the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.
the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.
which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.
They had dammed up the Tennessee River.
So, if you're a harmful variant
But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,
or they can be transmitted through the water.
Here's a girl who's almost dead.
and normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,
So, I don't really have time to talk about those things,
so you get increased virulence leading to
But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,
and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's
because I want to talk about diarrhea.
let's push the effort into that aspect of the control,
when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,
and the mosquitoes can't get to them.
when somebody eats contaminated food,
Now, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,
But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,
it produces a lot of toxin.
and actually all the way down into the sewer
But this, to me, suggests that we really need
about 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,
then I think that we can say,
or in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed --
encourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.
person-to-food-then-to-person contact,
and I won't go into that.
So what happens, if you've got an organism,
It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.
We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.
So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,
So this suggests we're on the right track.
But the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,
And this really cool experiment was done
when people get sick, they're sitting in bed --
It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that
to get the most bang for the intervention buck,
And this ethical problem's a big problem.
Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,
domesticate these organisms.
it looked like it got more harmful.
a lot of variation on which natural selection can act.
If you mosquito-proof houses,
so that -- we need to adjust our interventions
or person-food-person contact --
In this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity --
as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms
sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.
the highest potential waterborne transmission --
and how harmful they are,
which is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.
The whole point is that a person who can't move
And the logic's a little more subtle here.
Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.
we see, again, a lot of variation.
And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors
And the idea is very simple.
bring things back to the family,
What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.
That makes me worry a little bit.
And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us
If we look in the beginning of the 1990s,
we know that when you make them highly available
then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.
the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water,
you see a lot of variation in the toxin production.
I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,
but I'm not averse to, once that's happened,
So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.
that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.
evolution of harmfulness,
what somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,
all show a very strong, positive association between
in the very far left-hand side of this graph,
Just to give you a little perspective on this,
People will come in to those places where you've got
I don't think anybody knows,
then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.
Sometimes, you get disease organisms
to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,
into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,
and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.
and when you look at those strains,
see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.
how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?
as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.
Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,
How can we make the harmful organisms more mild?
But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.
This shows you the positions of some of these dams.
the main point here is that those data points
you had strains entering Chile --
is that often the kinds of interventions that you want,
and then the water may move into sources of drinking water.
and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.
we'd like to clean up the water supplies,
to move them to another host.
how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this
So, we can go to the same countries and look and see.
And we know that, although it's great to make those
It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine
that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.
In the case of waterborne transmission,
in antibiotic resistance.
to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.
And we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru
into the study of control of disease,
somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.
and they got no development of antibiotic resistance.
and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host
So the task is to try to figure out
you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease
because most of what's being done today is
besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension
if you've got a sick person in bed,
and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.
of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.
Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,
They got the organism to evolve to mildness,
then you might find a smaller number.
by cleaning up the water supply,
It's harmful because it produces a toxin,
the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.
So the other thing I really like about this,
Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,
So, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.
But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence
One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?
just the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,
And the answer is -- yep, they are.
I got a lot of strains from these different countries
In 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,
and actual selection favors pathogens
so that you can't get waterborne transmission:
you might find 10 million, or 100 million.
The goal is to turn this around.
if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.
And so what you can see is that
more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.
to walk outside and get mosquito bites.
than non-vector-borne diseases.
If the organism produced a lot of toxin,
So, you get this vicious cycle.
it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,
the mosquito proofing was complete.
and see whether or not the ones that tend to be
And so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation,
are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough
But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.
that vector-borne diseases are more harmful
So, this table I've given just to emphasize
in the harmfulness of disease organisms.
So, you've got a higher level of virulence.
So to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,
So, this is very encouraging,
to make disease organisms evolve to be mild?
So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,
And Peru's got something sort of in between.
that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.
So, we don't want to run an experiment like that.
to controlling the evolution of harmfulness
we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.
for example with anti-malarial drugs.
the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.
how can we use this knowledge
if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,
they needed electric, hydroelectric power.
even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,
And you can test these ideas.
which has some of the least well protected?
And the data really do support this:
then we expect that the winners of the competition
and take those strains and spew them out in different countries.
But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.
favored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.
Every row across here represents one of those 11 zones.
And to just give you a sense of how important this might be,
we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.
some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little --
But if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,
you're certainly not going to eradicate.
the degree of waterborne transmission,
And these are the data.
to ask some additional questions.
They evolved to produce less toxin.
And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,
Peru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.
rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem
but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,
they mosquito proofed every house.
by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
that are more likely to cause damage.
working in the direction we want it to go,
After a few days of infection you end up having --
You actually see a great potential,
And so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism,
and within three years, about 100 dollars per house,
within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.
which has some of the most well protected water supplies
Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.
so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.
So, natural selection will favor organisms
Now, I can think of some possible experiments.
What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution
is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,
You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,
but something about the environment the people are living in,
what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?
more predator-like organisms.
mobile and fairly healthy for transmission.
This is a long-term solution.
that cause acute infectious disease,
a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.
In every case there's a lot of variation,
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --
Because what I've been doing for the last four years --
updating them, quietly dropping obsolete features,
And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity

It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really.
I read it three or four times and I think,

you know: "Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree."

That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.
it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run,
the share of single men having pre-marital sex,
And when I leave here, I'm going to go back
there's a really significant cost of sex.
So obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar
This shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria --
and prevalence based on the mortality data
the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?"
In Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time
So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,
So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.
But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.
actually would have happened even without any education campaign.
So that's what this figure shows you.
If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago
But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.
it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.
So if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me
in particular export volume, and HIV infections.
they still may not change their behavior.
There's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.
of the decline in prevalence in Uganda
in areas where there's less malaria.
Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,
So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.
even if they know everything about the disease,
from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.
40 or 50 years in a lot of places.
So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,
how do people respond to the epidemic?
If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,
about how we can use this kind of information to learn something
it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent
but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.
In Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,
the first thing I think we need to understand is:
may not be enough, at least not alone.
So I am going to talk about exports and prices.
change their behavior less in response to HIV
I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute
the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s
Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence
But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:
we can think about what the right kinds of policies are.
whether to add some new functionality to your program,
More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.
And the first thing that I want to talk about,
So one way to test to see whether we can explain
Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here --
this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports --
that these things are positively related.
and see what happened to their prevalence?
Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,
I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.
rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.
Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms --
But now I want to actually also question that.
It kills people in the prime of their lives.
if we know there's this externality --
fortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case
"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?"
And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.
we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000
are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.
But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.
that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.
the way than an economist does -- as an investment.
Other places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places
But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.
I hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS,
as an economist on the epidemic.
You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,
To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact
we can actually test that. And so it seems to be --
So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,
It's not the only place we had any interventions.
if we never had any contact with Asia.
And I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.
actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.
So this is another way to see this.
we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.
It's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.
we did see that kind of change in the 1980s.
then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.
And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.
If you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date,
It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.
It's been widely heralded.
AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.
and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.
By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,
And in fact among gay men in the US
And I can't wait to hear about what they are.
I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,
Because if you improve those things,
to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.
There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.
the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections --
But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,
even if you don't make those investments.
because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.
in improving maternal mortality rates.
What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data
Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.
and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.
it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.
on how much longer you expect to live in the future,
And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,
that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.
was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.
in combating poor indoor air quality,
I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.
the special case of Uganda, and the fact that
But how much you want to invest is going to depend
what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.
we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.
But that actually doesn't mean at all
The reason that we know that the ABC campaign
when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.
But it does suggest that that number might be a little big.
Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.
actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot
are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty,
And the way that I'm going to do that is,
So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times
that's a costly investment in your health.
or other policies that encourage trade,
Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,
those areas have higher prevalence than others.
But openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost
maybe we should be spending our money on instead.
You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa
And I started thinking about how else might we figure out
which is not a terribly representative group of people.
And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.
Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,
It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.
then there are all sorts of other things
do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?
and late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.
are STD patients and pregnant women,
is every time I think about research, there are more questions.
But it also tells us something about policy.
maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.
Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up
So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.
and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda
Coffee is Uganda's major export.
But in this middle region, between 20 and 45,
to decrease the growth in the epidemic.
There was a big decline in coffee prices.
So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.
So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.
You get on Google, you Google, and you find,
People aren't changing their behavior enough
Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline
So by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.
the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,
that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.
If version 10 is coming out next week,
So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,
that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.
And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.
in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,
you think this program is going to be active.
So we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here
And I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.
But this also tells us that one of these facts
So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS,
But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.
I think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,
Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.
And one part of that benefit is how much longer
We didn't see anything like that in Africa.
And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.
in order to think about policy.
part of public health and epidemiology.
that's going to help us think about the world.
Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,
It's also important to think about what the benefit is.
there's been testing in random samples of the population.
It's a huge change in a very short period of time.
who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.
And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,
that it's important to understand things about the epidemic
to think about a problem that's more traditionally
than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.
is to look and see is there more behavior change
in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.
But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.
it's important to think about how much it costs.
on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.
And I hope that I've convinced you maybe
this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.
Unfortunately, there's almost no good data
by actually one male steward on an airline flight,
some of the things that you did know.
But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists
with some of the data that I talked about before,
to what we get from testing random samples in the population,
Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.
The epidemic was introduced to the US
but eventually it kind of sucks you back in.
and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit
Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality
So if you combine the intuition in this figure
actually your estimates of prevalence are very close
So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about
Now in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.
unless we really understand how the epidemic works.
I was not thinking at all about economics,
This is not just through malaria.
a little bit on the increase later in the decade.
So it turns out, if you use this technique,
We have no consistent testing.
And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.
that we actually cannot develop effective policy
When I started working on these projects,
And then actually they track each other
that has had success in combating the epidemic.
Likewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,
We have no way to figure out what happened over time.
but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude
Starting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.
is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria
People really like to have sex.
and that to understand this you need to think about health
some years it's only pregnant women.
which is really the most important,
To do that I'm going to talk about my research
you can see they're both increasing.
But even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users,
We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.
and I wouldn't be at all worried about that
some of these things that you think that you do know.
it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria --
And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.
And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.
This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this,
In Uganda we see the prevalence went down.
that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,
and I'm actually also going to challenge
Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some --
So malaria is a disease that kills you.
And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.
On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett
are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.
It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.
that you might not know about the epidemic,
as HIV prevalence goes up.
and mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.
So you can see that both of these series --
we can really attribute that mortality to HIV.
These are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant.
you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,
That is a huge effect.
is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have
So today I'm going to talk about some things
We see almost no change in sexual behavior.
And what's really, really great about being here
But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.
it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,
UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,
really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.
But since there are very few other diseases that kill people,
People are learning more things about it.
your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.
And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.
There are more things that I think that I want to do.
the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,
to a decline in HIV prevalence.
every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,
for example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act
with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization --
and what kind of policies might be effective.
It's good for improving people's lives.
and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.
If you look at the blue line,
the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.
so I imagine you all know something about AIDS.
the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.
it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead
Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,
Areas with a lot of economic activity --
if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress --
So we're going to need to think about policy
is really good for developing countries.
So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.
And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,
You can see, almost without exception,
And this is a pretty well-educated audience,
And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:
that improving exports and improving development --
But your health decisions are the same.
From a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,
and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,
actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991
to think about problems of another.
It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.
if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,
We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.
But we really need to test that.
but I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.
or married men having extra-marital sex,
that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.
If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,
and sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.
If you think that 25 million people are infected,
But that's enormously important for policy.
for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.
After Belgrade, where I was born,

And then our relationship stopped.
and the razor blade or knife is the tool.
If I can do this for myself, you can do it for you.
And I sit everyday, eight hours --
and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves.
So you have to be there.
that's not my problem.

I'm asking two minutes of your time, that's so little.
and prepared yourself mentally and physically,
and you're just there together without sound,
And the time is six hours."
to go to territory that nobody's ever been.

The women would tell the men what to do.
and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach.
and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can.
I exchange into love and trust.

Or having the sound-isolated situation --
But my method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I fear,
the things I don't know,
If you don't go into that area and you don't fail,
They could not confront myself, with myself as a normal human being.
The curator said to me,
In the performance, the blood is the material,
It's this importance
Because there is nothing wrong with technology,
you see more of the things you like to see
And you know, I've been doing performances
And that makes a difference.

music is the highest -- absolutely highest art of all,
I'm taking all responsibility -- even killing me.
I was half-naked, I was full of blood and tears were running down my face.
and you can't rehearse performance,
And as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too.
I am not the same anymore.
So what you do here,
And this is why you're not changing.
On the table there are 76 objects
And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple.

This performance, maybe 10 or 15 years ago --
It can be music, it can be opera, it can be a theater piece,
The beginning of this performance was easy.
please take off your blindfolds.
but you actually missed the whole thing.
And I think that human beings right now need a change,
there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes,
the public was not anymore the group --
they're photographed, they're filmed by the camera,
then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere.
two and a half thousand dead, big, bloody cow bones.
and there will be an empty chair at the front,
and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want."
and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world
And after six hours were finished,
I want to show you the one who really changed my life,
It's not like a painting.
after eye-gazing chamber, you go to a chamber where you are lying down.
how you go back to simplicity in your own life.
How to count rice for six hours?
when satisfying work is finished --
and this changed everything.
There was so much pain and loneliness,
then you are ready to see something with a long duration,
But I sit for three months.
where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body.
And I understood that I have a very strong mission,
Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil,
There are instructions which say,
and they were with their wives.
The audience and the performer make the piece together.
since the last 40 years.
We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do
they're observed by me
The public comes in, and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats.
It was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces,
but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours
And then after this is performance, and then everything else.
I think failure is important
And we succeeded to meet in the middle
So many artists, so many different explanations,
but my explanation for performance is very simple.
So here I am washing
"I'm just going to sit at the chair,
You know, if you count rice you can make life, too.
you are actually repeating yourself over and over again.
People would give me the glass of water to drink,
for pleasure and for pain.

performance is time-based art.
with the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence.
And just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.
Performance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory,
And then after you finish, you get a certificate of accomplishment,
We are losing the time we have for ourselves.
And this is to experience a kind of simple method,
standing in the middle of the space.
We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye.
And now, it completely changed how I see the public.
which is very possible because it's been a long day,
you're going to be transported to the parking lot.
So it's the three basic positions of the human body,
this was before China was open in '87.
And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months,
And then I liberate myself from these fears.
and put the knife between my legs.
is about trust, is about total trust to another human being.
because the Balkan Wars are now finished, but there's always some war, somewhere.
And then after you've seen all of this,
And you know, sleeping is very important.
But what we do on the personal level --
And I'm your mirror.
And in my point, if you talk about immaterial art,
But it's six hours, the experience.
So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time,
but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before --
You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable.
And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening,
and say, you know, "This is over."
you have to give me your word of honor.
Welcome to the performance world.
two and a half thousand kilometers.
It's all about being there in the real time,
I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience.
And we made, for 12 years, performances together.
it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way.
what is our contribution to this whole thing?
"That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York,
like in immaterial art.
It's incredibly important.
so get home and frame it if you want.
started walking towards the public.
is I went to the hotel, it was at two in the morning.
So this institute right now is virtual.
You can use everything on the table on me.
and I had a piece of gray hair.
and the blood is just ketchup.
and becoming possible -- an unbearable smell.
and 10 hours on Friday when the museum is open 10 hours,
or the story of somebody else telling you,
After slow walking, you're going to learn how to drink water --
And one very important piece I made in those days
So I'm washing this six hours, six days, and wars are coming off these bones,
But the need of people to actually experience something different,
And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time.
But then something stays in the memory.
You have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there.
If you want to get experience, you have to give me your time.
You do things in life --
And I removed the table and I'm still sitting,
and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made.
and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.
This is orientation hall.
and there's wars -- the killing.
Performance is a mental and physical construction
You can't wash the blood, you never can wash shame off the wars.
Because thinking about immateriality,
And this is how, for me, was born the idea
and then energy dialogue happens.
first you start slow walking, you start slowing down.
and I still have the scar.
You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets,
And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,
This is an institute to actually give you back this time.
And then also to include the failure.
Breathe slowly, don't try to blink, don't be self-conscious.
It was climbing, it was ruins.
very simple, drinking water for maybe half an hour.
you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work.
and the only change to be made is a personal level change.
It's something so old-fashioned,
And the difference between performance and theater is huge.
or go home with your certificate.
is to start with yourself.
Thank you for trusting me.
And here I met Ulay,
After this, you're going to the magnet chamber,
You know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry,
because if you go, if you experiment, you can fail.
You have to make the change on yourself.
and to change the world around us,
It's so easy to criticize how it's different,
This performance -- when I said to the curator,
this chair will be empty,
that you never even say one word -- everything happened.
that I have to communicate this experience
You have to sign the contract before you enter the building,
our approach to technology is wrong.
You're going back to simplicity.

After crystal chamber, you go to eye-gazing chamber,
And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get
In the theater, the knife is not a knife
I'm using your energy,
It was the mountains, it was difficult.
nothing would have happened.
because it's the most immaterial.
And then you go to the lockers
Because the only way to change consciousness
Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood,
because you can't do many of these types of things twice -- ever.
And there is a sound chamber.
Which is very important, the performance is --
we're afraid of mortality.
the opening of the museum --
there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes,
that you will spend there a full six hours,
Can you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know,
and he was the person I actually fell in love with.
So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely
let's go back in time.
First of all, let's explain what the performance is.
We are always doing things we like in our life.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
because in the gaze with that total stranger,
they had a very strong impact.
So let's begin with a group of images.
that haunts me still, much more than the others.
My company has 70 million images.
Well, this image you've all seen.

What's happening in genomics,
You know, they are generally put together in pairs,
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.
Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor,
we then started on this journey to understand that
Our ocean's teaming with microbes;
and we find that this toolbox is very extensive.
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,
We could conceivably expand the climate window:
maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?
All we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs,
and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,
So, I will tell you right off of the bat.
we can figure out what they are.
figured out they can make things if they used a tool.
and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.
So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox,
Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,
running around and eating and doing each other
they, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes;
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,
and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.
So, then what do you do?
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question:
with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.
They're easy to sequence: unlike a human,
So, we are now able to read genomes.
Not only does it do that; if you took the genome -- that synthetic genome --
first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule --
Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?
It's all hidden in this code,
but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.
in your washing machine, your cell phone.
using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,
And what that means is, you are going to walk around
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,
There are thousands of microbes there.
And with these four letters, you can create a language:
In fact -- I'm sorry to inform you --
It's, sort of, like if you ask people,
that I have struggled with for a long, long time.
So, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance;
we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth --
to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.
you will see that happen in the next five years.
Well, guess what. It does.
Living in your genome is the history of our species,
and we now have the ability to use it.
you end up with a lipid that is highly refined.

So, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever.

he's not always the most politically correct guy ...
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.
They recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes,
they would not exist in nature on their own.

We reorganize things, we change them around,
we've been able to create with just a one and a zero.
which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.
So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything.
and maybe it's going to make it work.
They're here. They're in the universe.
I will also tell you we're at least as buggy.
What does a genome look like?
you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation
that makes the difference between any one of us.
Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself,
and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.
Nature will not allow you to --
For me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,
They're going to make all that stuff go away.
Are we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?
the software, if you will, changes the hardware.
DNA is a very elegant molecule.
that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,
is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.
and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,
and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.
You can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.
There also is a set of rules.
It's not really all that much data.
there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere
It's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.
So, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?
and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,
It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material

And that may not sound very intuitive,
it is what makes every organism function.
but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species
We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate

So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.
You want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?
into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.
we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.
you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;
and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.
And then we understand what is terroir.
and how we've gone from big computers to little ones
we say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.
It is what makes you function;
as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.
We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,
In a human being, down in here it could be:
By the way, just so you know:
I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.

and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.
about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.

We can start to figure that out.
Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things
and that makes you a human being.
assuming this is a grape plant:
And, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular
that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.
that those compounds that it's cranking out
sequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like --
It's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
A lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,
you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.
We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,
like cancer, we haven't been able to cure
And they mix up in all different fashions,
You will give your genome to the pharmacist,

And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA --

Well, you know, I think the answer is very simple:
in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,

as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,
So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you.
because we understand how it actually works,
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.
So, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them,
Then we go along and create the Internet

Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.

This company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with,
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.
People never want to say, I really don't understand.
When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.
So, let's talk about what that means.
they're understanding what these do and what they mean.
Everything that happens in digital is converted,
you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.
and you as an individual human being, where you're from,
We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;
what creates the starchiness inside of a grain,
that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease --
we can go for higher yields without necessarily having
you've probably heard that at some point in time.
so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity
We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?
we're just learning what the rules are.
a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.
If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,
... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"
The language of technology is binary;
is what makes changes in humans and in all species.
And, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology:
I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.
in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device --
Carbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,
We can understand functionality. This is really important.
Nature has put a set of rules out there.
because I come from a very cold climate.
but we don't make anything unnatural.
Well, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,
and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.

In other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around;
We can't make the grape plant produce babies.
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson --
And this is extremely profound.
we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:
That's a tiny amount of material,
So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in --
This is not big news to viticulturists;
The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.
But there's an ecosystem here.
we could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.
They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock;
and who would have thought back then that every single person
Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures

It's long and it's complicated.
You can find out where your relatives come from;
that is not genetically modified.
And look at all the complex things and wonderful things
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.

Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it --
you will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.
going back tens of thousands of years.
doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.
which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,
How's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?
We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s,
but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.
If you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300.
it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;
All of these things could conceivably be done,
And we've seen many seminal moments.

and we now can use those.
and it's going over the network,
They've also discovered that

And all I can tell you is, stay healthy for 20 years.
but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.
we can fix them, make better organisms.
So, up to this point we tried to fix it
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,
that don't appear to function every day,
Because we can understand this,
by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.
we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,
We are starting to understand that.
We could produce better flavors and aromas.
the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature,
you won't have side effects.
that's just a big database -- and then fertilize.
Well, actually, you could do it the other way.
We all talk about terroir; we worship terroir;
It is the program. It is the code of life.
what we inherit, what diseases we may get.
And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.
These are chemical factories;
If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,
When you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros,

There are microbes, you know -- go back to yeast.
and your drug will be made for you
And you would, you know, when you think about it,
it is the microbes that live in their root systems,

that grow in very hard-to-grow environments,
and without, you know, the organized religion part,
If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI --

We actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.
Well, there's many things. Some are exciting.
There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.
We've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now --
Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.
And that moved us to the next level.
and how this revolution is about to change everything we know
and that's now starting to be understood.
now that we're starting to have the book of life?
I consider myself a very spiritual person,
They have discovered pathways that create flavors,
So, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces.
Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.
if I want to emphasize it and make it more important.
-- you know, what's visible, what's not.
I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way.
Also just like paper, around our workspace
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.
and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it.
Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop.
and I can do the same thing here,
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs
So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know --
I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles
or I can lay them out like a deck of cards.
how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?
Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared,
Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up
I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software --
When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system.
I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs.
or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?
and I'd like to change all that.
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing.
And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.
kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned.
OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?
Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?
and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.
And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac,
I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.
And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull,
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,
we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later,
And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.
for these individual icons we thought -- I mean,
and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices.
and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing.
okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here,
instead of just the folders that we have.
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger
because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.
and, you know, toss it to the corner.
So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that,
More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable --
And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop.
But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this,
but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?
So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?
So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them,
you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer."
And that's BumpTop. Thanks!
you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last,
or you know, flip through them like a book
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.
Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke.
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral

And she goes, "And what's this fertilizing?"
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids.
That's how we evolved. It does seem odd.
And we watched them and I'm so thankful,
And then she goes, "What if there was like a party,
And then I realized that
And then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?
and all I could remember was,
And we were at this restaurant,
We have evolved to have our own pond.
they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.
And she said, "But Mom, you can't have kids."
And I go, "Oh, it's the same. It's basically the same."
I was trying to remember all the guidebooks,
And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos.
or she had some homework about frogs.
And then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.
And she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?"
funny you should ask. (Laughter)
Men, through their penis,
"Mom, how do cats do it?"
I didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.
'Is now the time to take off my pants?'"
So we go online, and we put in "cats mating."
she was doing a report for school
So how could that ever happen?"
And I said, "Oh, no. Humans are so private.
And then they become tadpoles and frogs."
have you done this before?"
Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes,
Mom, does the man just say,
and then the males fertilize them.
That would never happen."
And I thought, "Okay, here we go."
And when she was eight, last year,
like, where do women lay their eggs?"
but men and women can't ever see each other naked, Mom.
like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"
do you think they would have, on the Internet,
And she goes, "Then how do they get fertilized?"
Like, how do they know that's the time?
and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter)
It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs,
That's not how we do it."
And I said, "I know.
(Laughter) (Bagpipes)
MM: Okay. So, I'm told we're ready, which means
3D models and place them in the world around me,
Teacher: And then, have you got it again?
and effectively store it and tag it to something physical
and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do
let's now move on to technical advancements,
and you, you have to be flexible, you have to be willing
What we have here is a painting
and educators have really got on board with the classrooms.
MM on video: One, two, three. Go!
So, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster,
So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed.
but if we now switch inputs over to the phone,
effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen,
but nonetheless, here is the device.
It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing
So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones
as we're walking around being able
Voice: Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...
I have a picture here from a video, and we're now going to play it.
We have people who have, for example,
So then, after the fun, comes the more emotional side
of the great poet Rabbie Burns,
that we share, we discover, and that we enjoy
(Laughter) MM: Awesome. Thank you.
My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router,
that exists in the real world.
and then have it actually recognize images and objects
They're not very animated. (Laughter)
on the count of three, and go over to here.
and we've talked a little bit about the educational side.
this is how advanced these devices have become.
Move away from it and come back to it.
Again, the thing that's incredible about this is
Teacher: Now move it either side. See what happens.
So, as sort of — I'm told it's called a stadium wave,
So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks,
like the human brain, and then be able to pull in information
here in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge,
So let me start with this.
Okay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge,
Second child: It's magic.
They couldn't all be on stage, but we're going to
-- so, a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical
so I have one over here.
so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more,
There's nothing done to this image.
and I've got a lovely picture of them here.
changed the way that we live and work,
and the great thing is, if you're a professional user,
we can now point at the image, and there you all are.
and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just
and for that person to be able to take a moment in time
and make it a part of the world around us.
actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand
Oh, there we are. We can save it now.
much like how the human brain does.
One, two, three. Go!
The only difference is that you've got the ability
could see the world in the same way that we do,
MM: I should leap in.
it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.
I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk.
And what's great about this is the technology's
Now, this has applications everywhere,
because now we can literally take the content
The incredible work that made that possible was done
whether in things like art in museums, like you just saw,
to convert that image that we just took
taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car
All the processing to do that was actually done
MM: And that linking of the digital content
that was never before possible.
and tagged up different components within an engine,
more convenient way to get information in the real world,
and experiences and ideas.
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it.
and it's just a normal image,
to what we've just used to create this demonstration.
so that everyone here understands — (Laughter) —
(Bagpipes) (Applause)
Not only that, but as I move the object around,
If you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G,
MM: Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you.
Tamara, would you like to jump in?
Matt Mills: Now, what's great about this is,
It's available for everyone to do,
What you can see over here is Tamara,
Congratulations. You have now completed setup.
and we have some Wimbledon news, which is great.
into a sort of digital fingerprint,
So what I have here is a wireless router.
(Laughter) MM: (Laughs) So, it's not magic.
On the emotional side, we have people who've
and that means that I can now take cinema-quality
so we're going to start from this side of the room
and immediately get the bulletin.
Well, traditionally that was seen as science fiction,
(Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter)
and she does all that. She's won this title.
because since we started putting this technology
and when she points at this image,
from an almost infinite library of knowledge
Child: Oh my God! How did you do that?
allows you to see the world through someone's eyes,
(Music) (Dinosaur roaring)
something magical happens.
to something that's physical is what we call an aura, and
Okay, so are you all ready?
or in the world of, say, advertising, or print journalism.
And here is this morning's newspaper,
bring their aura to the stage, so here they are.
by doing one right now.
who is holding my phone that's now plugged in.
but there are times when actually using this medium
to change direction at a split second,
running our technology, you can see
Voice: ... To the grass, and it's very important that you adapt
Now, we have lots of people who are doing this already,
you can point and discover the information.
We're all very, very familiar with the Internet.
In the last 20 years, it's really
to add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready?
there's no trickery here.
MM: Fellows are really good at that. (Laughs) (Laughter)
Teacher: See what happens. (Children talking) Keep going.
into the Aurasma application,
done things like send postcards and Christmas cards
for the device online, I can simply point at it,
and they work in our offices,
So now what I can do is, rather than getting the instructions
back to their family with little messages on them.
Voice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable.
Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper
and a great example of this is a school in the U.K.
to point a phone at anything,
of what we do, because effectively, this technology
teachers who've tagged up school classrooms,
Child: Oh, that is so cool.
on mobile phones less than 12 months ago,
this process is very, very quick.
the device is recognized, and then --
Then connect the power. Finally, the yellow ethernet cable.
allows you to be able to display information in a way
the speed and the processing in these devices
we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift,
has grown at a really phenomenal rate,
This was the fourth take, I'm told. (Laughter)
They're open, they're available to everyone within our application,
took onto my badge, so that I can remember it forever.
where actually this has become possible.
Tamara Roukaerts: We're ready to go.
and the way that we see the world, and what's great is,
What's great about this is, the tools to do this are free.
So, I did this work for her.
and most of the time, we don't see what it is.
because the actual journey happens between those footprints,
And cow crossed the road,
of how, everyone can interpret it.
Then I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries
which as a human, we don't see them?
because my friend's family
this is the trace of sun.
And what I'd like to tell you
So this is what I was talking about, while molding,
you will miss the point
If you just ask an opinion
They never wrote back to me.
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that --
revolve around three subjects,
Will you help me to make this sculpture?"
So it was good to survive with that little tool
or we can break the sculpture and get the dust,
but they are not aware of it.
I can see that most of the works
and he said unto the cow,
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
it just makes me feel like:
or whatever traces we leave as humans."
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch --
to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
So I was working on the line,
the last 10/15 years --
who produces that air freshener called Odonil,
Again, throwing light, then the third one.
thumbprint, footprint,
This is called "Limit Out."
And then moved slowly
But if you tear it in the middle --
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
but what is happening will remain invisible only.
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India
Then, again, that becomes an object.
with asking help from [the] Unknown
to explore that territory.
"Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."
because it's in the air.
they always talk about the appreciation of art.
So where it's happening, we can see,
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting,
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper
and now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception --
I used to go to sleep
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith
This is how we've been taught in school.
And that fascinated me,
if he saw the same cow, he would say,
that's also not true,
You know, like just adjacent to me.
So that produced a shadow.
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."
So I remember those nights
whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.
and there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.
and this is called length.
And if they say they don't get it,
like these three people are sitting here.
This is the work I made out of that material.
we don't see gravity, we don't see electricity.
because, knowingly or unknowingly,
and there is an element of sculpture,
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
and someone happened to sit next to me,
then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
So there is an element of performance,
depends on your frame of reference."
what I really want to do with art work, or art
without having their motives called into question."
the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world
that goes from solid substance to vapor.
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint
you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."
It's almost like a 3D photograph.
or it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.
or the road moved underneath the cow,
around 13 years old,
So I just put the paper on the focal length,
It can be ruins, or it can be music,
It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.
The little dust particle will again, reflect the light,
So this work from this period
This is after 15/20 days.
is nothing but a trace of myself.
The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist.
because we cannot go back [to] the past.
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait,"
[the] college of arts after three attempts
So do we really understand what it is,
it just shows what is on the other side.
The same thing in the darkroom.
creates this meaning.
is only by the traces available,
So all of our construction of reality
play a major role to understand it.
after being quiet and not working for about six, seven months,
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
because of the focal length of the lens,
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
you know -- what I really enjoyed the most
the way to understand the past
He would say, "For the greater good."
and we will give you all the details," and they gave.
the perception and context
I did this as an experiment
So this work is nothing but like --
but it's filled with light all the time.
when you cannot move even an inch,
So here, what happened then,
Don't you think it remained something about death," they said.
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity."
but if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.
This is the fee for the project report,
each and every corner of my life at that time.
or is there other ways to capture it?"
this is the first skin, and this is the second,
that one is becoming the other.
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.
"The fact that you're at all concerned
So this is after a few weeks,
We don't feel, "I am touching the air,"
They said, "Of course.
when we try to understand them,
and started getting help from everywhere,
It's like after every exam, when I walk out,
all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
it just gives the appearance
we cannot hear everything, we cannot see everything.
whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it's possible.
Even though we have traces
The skin of this is also representing this.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
or moving my hand or, moving around in the space,
good, bad, tall, short --
So this is called "Self In Progress."
it's actually [the] past, what makes a person.
our senses are so limited --
you know, maybe, you know,
she'll simply say, "To get to the other side."
So I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."
I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.
we see the source of the light.
so many memories come back to me.
because we have freedom of like walking,
even when we say dark, light,
It's called "Emerging Angel."
It just all depends on one's perception.
"Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"
and the footprints are nothing but passing time.
"What really makes us?" -- you know,
which is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything,
So, why I'm telling you this,
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,
Facilitating Unit and ask help."
And one of those competitions,
Is there any way to capture the thought
Because when I was capturing traces, you know,
but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
The moment I say "school,"
it's such a great experience,
it's on the other side,
they were looking at it and they said,
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking,
And this was collected by Anupam --
You just quit school and come there."
It's about six inches deep in the wall,
is always not there;
I started capturing traces.
but it was not intentional.
who also collect art which can depreciate.
you should study in a school of art.
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
that I found to find my own place in school.
This is an exact negative.
So what we conceive as a meaning
but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
is just what we think often,
While I was doing that work,
but there are a few collectors
of a shadow of a shadow.
is there anything behind, are there any traces up there,
This is the trace of fire,
is called "Shadow Foreshadow."
but still, the meaning of this changes.
but instead of working about traces,
But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,
This is the craft that was going on,
So what you see is nothing but shadow
So it took about 24 hours to get this line.
the space between this object and there.
I couldn't believe what my father and mother
now, I didn't touch this breadth,
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
it'll become 30,000 in two months.
while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore?
but let him send to the drawing competitions."
because, for some reason,
"God came down from heaven,
You buy this for 3,000 rupees,
"Oh, he's bad at studies,
whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,
that maybe there is many more possibilities
go to the other side of the wall, like illogic,
He would definitely say,
had something else as a god.
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture
Because we can create
we should move beyond, you know,
on what happened between that time
the same cow walking around the street.
So, I just started doing this work
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.
And to really get to the point,
When I look back, you know,
Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees
In India, nobody really talks about works of art;
makes the air come out and go in.
when you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.
When I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators --
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.
and finally I'm here in front of you.
it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.
in one of the signboard artists called Putu.
and I didn't know where else to find myself.
the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
Can you make something from nothing
But it is just a kind of trace of that time.
it will not be solid, it will evaporate.
as just a symbol or a sign?
Then move towards questioning the perception
I started working in a part-time job
So we don't see dark, we don't see light,
between the glass box and the wood,
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.
If you look at this piece of paper,
is there any way to use all this
It's a false wall, which contains
and I was listening to just radio,
what we think it is?
It's about eight inches deep.
and we realize the existence of light.
in the other hand, when you say the truth, they hated you.
Through that small little slit
it's merged with the whole."
it may not be the portrait after a few months.
So my request was like,
and just continue to inquire
So at that time -- and I was 13 --
or are we trying to get
when I was changing the air freshener
It's a full-figure cast from myself.
in one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"
but the moment it evaporates,
he would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road,
is through these limited senses.
"I imagine a world where all cows will be free
"It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow.
and, you know, even from their mobiles.
Again, "Inward Out."
And I didn't understand why,
"this is tucked in some small solid,
Martin Luther King would say,
you can see people listening to radio
of casting the shadow.
I would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."
because this is plaster of Paris, so the moment you pour it it's like liquid;
"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions.
So that's what made me enter
the way we train to perceive the reality
Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist.
this is after a few months.
This is called "Gravity."
So I just switched on in the train, loudly.
But a solution arrived
the teacher would say, "Hey, come.
It's just that being a human,
The answer can be so different if Potter said it.
until I reached home.
And skin at the other end also represents the floor.
but the moment this becomes solid,
It's just a trace of being in this body.
"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
And I didn't have the patience to wait
is it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace,
And context, what is really context?
And I was like, "What do you mean?"
You can see the detail.
If we sculpt this, this has two reference points.
So I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown
So here are some of the works I would like to show you.
and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow."
And what I'd like to tell you,
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."
is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too;
He's been suffering from right hip pain for a while."
that if you went to renew your license tomorrow,
where I eliminated the middle option.
and about their examples, and where they disagree,
And worse -- not having an easy way to see them,
So I decided to try and write something more fun.
I showed some people a picture of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.
We wake up in the morning and we open the closet;
Vision is one of the best things we do.
which was get only the print for 125,
If I asked you what's longer, the vertical line on the table on the left,
it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing.
So I want to show you some cognitive illusions,
I realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting.
and not just to Rome without coffee -- even superior to Paris.
Germany is on the left, and Austria is on the right.
The countries on the right, the ones that give a lot,
So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced.
in the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.
People believe that when we deal with physical attraction,
Now I looked at this, and I called up The Economist,
and you encountered one of these forms,
And even being here -- I mean, the last few days,
of European similarity,
I never thought about.
after mailing every household in the country a letter,
And the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom
makes Rome with coffee look superior,
"Look, if you're serious about this,
I'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making.
aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it.
The Netherlands is on the left, and Belgium is on the right.
Now, think about what this means.
If I cover the rest of the cube, you can see that they are identical.
Not yours, of course -- other people's.
Something we don't have an evolutionary reason to do,
it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute.
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer?
All these medications, nothing seems to be working.
This of course has two very clear implications
But if you look at this plot,
And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook.
and I said, "Who do you want to date?
or decision-making illusions, in the same way.
Now, weekend in Paris, weekend in Rome -- these are different things.
"Look, that's the only way you'll ever do it."
The countries on the left have a form at the DMV
given that you can have Rome with coffee,
What do you do? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen?
People don't check, and they don't join.
Similar, but slightly uglier.
help their respective, more attractive brothers?
Are we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?
This is why we have these four-minute dates.
The general point is that,
If you want coffee, you have to pay for it yourself, it's two euros 50.
I'll show you images here, no real people, but the experiment was with people.
"What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason!"
is probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are.
that nothing is working for this patient.
The silver lining is, I think,
you can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not,
so that's why we get this effect."
This is actually a painting
This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality
Video: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid
Are you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,
that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.
And there you see the stagecoach driver,
we'd like to take cells from your windpipe.
for structures which are much larger
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.
And that's actually what you're seeing.
has a cell population
This is how to stop a runaway stage.
we just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.
But we have a major shortage of organs.
What do we do when we have injuries
And we can then create functional livers.
such as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,
and every single organ in your body
So, I always like to show this cartoon.
organs such as the heart,
This is actually a very stunning statistic.
these materials are fairly complex
For the second phase of the trials
with the patient's own liver cells.
More complex structures
it looks like a liver, but it has no cells.
We take muscle cells, we paste,
But it takes a lot to get there.
a lot of blood vessel supply,
then we'd like to use donor stem cells.
These are major issues.
It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.
We perfuse the outside of the liver
we can hold it like a liver,
Your body has many organs
It's not really that foreign of a concept, actually;
She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.
it feels like a liver,
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.
we actually exercise it.
are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,
create the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.
Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges
So, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.
And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.
then you can create that bridge, and cells
blood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree
And this is an X-ray showing you
Actually, we can regenerate.
And for those we still need stem cells.
and then we then use scaffold materials.
We exercise these prior to implantation.
We can take cells from you,
to bridge those gaps.
six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,
from the outside environment,
muscle, and these bladder specialized cells.

Trying to replace pancreas,
Why? Because they will not reject.
We brought patients in,

It basically wants to fight off infection,
And we can then tubularize this scaffold.
you see the muscle cells contract.
Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power
and we then place the scaffold back into the patient.
Again, fairly more complex organs,
like heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.
not just for organs but also for tissues.
grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,
and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.
then we'd rather use your very own cells.
We then tease the tissue apart
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.
And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered.
and about four to six hours later
we place the cells on the scaffold,
And you start layering these solid structures.

You then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.
And that scar actually grows out
Here we take a scaffold,
You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,
in terms of actual therapies for organs.
And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,
and look at its basic components,
but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.
We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials
Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ

So, we prefer organ-specific cells.
This is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.

This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.
It's a five second clip of a patient

What about other structures?

you can put the organ right back into the patient.

Your skin regenerates every two weeks.
and we then can use very mild detergents
The bottom is usually the surgeons.
So, at this point, I do want to tell you that
and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.
So, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex
as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.
organs that are discarded,
So, what can we do about it?
the cells to regenerate new tissue,
Okay. These are flat structures that we see here,
and the placenta, which have those properties.
It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing
Why? Because we'd rather take those cells
The strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us
We place it back into this oven-like device.

they're definitely more complex

That's exactly what you see here.
All we are left with

once we put it into the patient.
And we prefer cells that will not reject
because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.
If you present with a diseased wind pipe
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.

For solid organs, they're more complex

Two weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up,
of our bodies, to actually heal ourselves?
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,
but by far, the most complex solid organs
So, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.
We then take the cells, the vascular cells,
I'm going to show a clip of one young lady.

we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.

engineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.
And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies
is to seal itself off from the rest of the body.
and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells
Some of the work you saw today
Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate?
except for several which we still need stem cells for,
The kidney was indeed the first organ
is actually to create wafers
So, we have patients now walking around with organs,
we use very mild detergents,
these technologies really are not that easy.
But as we age, our organs tend to fail more.
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.
So, another strategy we're following
actually harvesting the kidney.
Same strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,
But actually method A is the correct approach.
everything works. Actually no,

But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients,
We don't need to teach it to become another cell type.
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.
This actually shows the scaffold.
because you're asking these organs to act on demand.
You can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.

I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab].
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.
we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs.
There's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.
that Rover is going down in that crater.
we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface
As I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth,
If we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.

it's not very far from us.
that we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini.
and you've got your car filled up.
but every once in a while it's good to be lucky.
And then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument,
that we put them in an oven and actually heat them
which will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it,
because we didn't want to contaminate the surface;
17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,
which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.
CE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.
This is actually taken from the satellite
You just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it,
Well, I always say it's important that you are smart,
because we believe they represent, on a small scale,
and that looks like an ocean.
I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA.
Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving
So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples
And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn,
So anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit
It probably gets about room temperature.
And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form,
So as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know,
And that was done over a period of a couple of years,
that one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office,
it's not working very well, so it's walking like this,
This is not animation or anything like this.
you don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline.
As you saw a little bit earlier,
and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island,
Tell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.
It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space
It branches on more the experimental side.
And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface
And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,
EB: The inside doesn't get very hot.
And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,
By the way, all of this is real stuff.
BC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem.
But also, if there is something that we cannot reach
an instrumental rock band.
another ingenious idea of how do we land it.
organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.
So, we do something a little bit more serious.
And these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,
we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.
You barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.
And one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go
we are driving it backwards.
And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell.

So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with
So as we flew by away from it, we looked back. And guess what?
And here we made 180 degrees change:
So it's about the size, you know, of the United States.
So just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor
And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.
one of the front wheels, so what we are doing,
We're 70 miles above the surface of Mars.
One, it's a very attractive planet --
And anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them.

I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.

and that's the one you see on the left in there.
RG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
BC: We enter the Martian atmosphere.
on what that Saturnian system looks like.
And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.
You've got to do what you want to do.
EB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft
what is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it
exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.
EB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun.
which was actually formed on that one.
So, let me show you a little bit
You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see,
We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.
So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall
it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.
And we actually used the combination of the satellite images
So, we wanted to find out, actually,
Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know,
That was [unclear] also -- you know, because we were worried
after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,
about four years ago.
down to 900 miles an hour.
There is a -- I'm not sure you can see it very well,
Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.
in a soft way in a very short amount of time.
in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room,
during the tea break, you know, in here.
So we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing
are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started
and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.
from the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,
there used to be competition and parades and so on.
and actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL,
If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation,
and look where he is looking.
and still providing all the science data.
So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.
I thought I'd go to "The Lord of the Rings" now
and stacking them on top of one another.
Recently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like --
We no longer need the heat shield to protect us
the environment of the planet where we are going.
and you can see some of the features on it,
look where the other people are looking,
Eric Nyquist, had put a series of displays,
[is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane,
or lots of people's imagination -- somehow from that original Big Bang
Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,
And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist.
that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder,
So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,
That's like taking two Empire State Buildings
which have happened on that planet.
Next step, we go and actually build some kind of test models
On the right, also, we have to take into account
in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin.
but that's exactly why they are lasting that long
at 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt
as a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center,
So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching
What it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid,
Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working.
as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.
So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know,
I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.
So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,
about some of the talent that we have.
we started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile."
relative to the people standing there.
Yes, they are very large in one dimension;
And now we designed them reasonably well,
because water would have frozen.
So it will be a very tense moment, you know,
100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.
because we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking
at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.
Now, in that case, because it was a very big Rover,
we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft
But then also, just to celebrate that,
So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events
other than the science community.
Now, you think that those rings are very large objects.
And we really love being close to the art center, because we have,
and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets,
a little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.
So that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example
but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,
And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere.
BC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour
I think that should say 30 miles,
BC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute,
It's a satellite which was all made of ice,
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets,
It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,
this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft
We started from those stars; we are made of stardust.
to be as imaginative as they can.
Well, I don't recommend that you try to do that now.
we have to stop and touch the surface very softly
CE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here.
before life actually started on it.
above that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane
on the surface of another planet.
when it's going to get rid of its parachute.
And the reason I showed the little arrow there,
One of them is called Enceladus.
because that doesn't get you very far.
if you don't take the oceans into account.
Rob Grover: Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft,
I tried to come like him this morning,
So we literally are all made out of stardust.
It is like a brand new car that you have,
First we start by we want to have our employees
and see which one blows up more.
And what these layers -- that's what the surface used to be
And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,
But one area which is particularly intriguing for us
And that will be basically built over the next year,
We are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them
so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection
all of these things, which they work in a team effort
an efficient kind of machine.
we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.
as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals
Now, when I came last time, shortly after the landing --
We'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes
So it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago
Actually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover
So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,
that's a heat shield which is going to protect it.
So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;
but the land mass on Mars is about the same
from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience.
So in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?
Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?
and made sure that it's all working well.
and therefore life could have evolved on it.
and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.
and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting,
from the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me,
But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.
That big shield that you see outside,
And somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers
sometimes there are setbacks.
It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,
you know, outside the science community about these Rovers,
and this cork is what's going to protect us
Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.
Is that very common?
there tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place
It looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes,
always people ask, why do we explore?
to the stage of becoming biological material,
which is used here on Earth for helicopters.
Now, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention,
It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken
EB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.
you know, if that happened, so we have to test,
and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain
Now, this is really special cork,
or scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties,
the whole planet will blow up.
of the kind of people we have there.
So this was launched about nine months ago.
So it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real.
Being able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig
So we came up with this ingenious idea,
and make more accurate measurements.
so you see sand dunes.
And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car.
which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know,
Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.
And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings,
On the other hand, if you light a match
So, that gives you a kind of flavor
And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while
we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here,
and look what gases will come from it.
and actually analyze what's coming from that rock.
that's the Rover just before we finished its testing
BC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.
exploring space on all of your behalf.
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data.
and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.
how the Solar System actually formed.
how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.
a pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get
to make sure that it's in the right position to land.
That's more on the play side. And on the right side,
This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,
And then we actually do the actual building and the flight.
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet,
Richard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity
and now we are the leading organization, you know,
each one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps
and it says, "Do not go where the path may lead.
and we can move the arm, you know, that way.
this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch
Then we get a little bit more serious, so we have
that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water
we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.
and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out
There's the improvisational side of jazz.
So, specifically what we are doing now is
when we entered one of the floats.
how far Phoenix really is from the ground.
So this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.
How did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?
that we have to face.
And the reason Mars takes particular attention:
BC: And on the front of it is this heat shield,
and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals
How did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?
near the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission
because it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system
So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call
called Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land
and basically go to a certain location.
but it's also trying to use all of its actuators
so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.
We saw geysers coming out.
So these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know,
and explore that is to go towards Mars.
EB: Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less.
with different shapes and different designs.
All that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:
we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.
But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning,
as it's going down, you know, that canyon.
and then you can get those Rovers to move around
So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars,
LC: So it's in a free-fall,
the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect
And then we back off, you know, from that point.
It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,
And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson
So if you were on Mars -- sorry, on Titan,
which was not too far from here on Orange Grove,
who are having a conversation here.
Ben Cichy: Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission.
It's very similar to what you do when you design your product.
it just has the beauty of the rings and so on.
You see the rivers which are coming along the coast,
Maybe they're right - I doubt it.

because we can observe large areas
Camera. We have a picture right now.

First, I'm going to fly you over the rings.
and here we have intelligent people like you and I

Just looked like the coast of California for me.
so that it can land itself safely.

We flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of
and activity is going on as we speak today.
LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,
just to make sure we understand how, where would they break.
So, think about it as a paper-thin,
there is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.
We have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said,
but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.
As a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult
all that life that you see around you,
and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust
So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of,
of that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,
So it will have an arm which will take samples,
It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen
mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.
So it is a dynamic planet,
We kick them, we hit them, we drop them,
close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.
but on the top left, around 10 o'clock,
and go do something different, you know, and doing that.
write the book of how things have came about as they are today.
You know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,
just to get people to think wildly about things.
As I said, they were adventurous people.
the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.
Now, "The Lord of the Rings" has two things played through it.
it'll already be over.
Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material,
It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;
an increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes
It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.
Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned.
you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment
And that's one of the satellites
Wherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else,
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth,
90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,
and show you some of the things we have there.
and we're now in free-fall.
we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.
when we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw
or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.
So, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively
similar to what you put in your car.
we have this beautiful world that we live in today.
but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last
as we were orbiting Saturn.
What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around,
and we actually saw the Rover on the surface.
And we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.
EB: That's when we separate from the back shell,
well, that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags.
But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.
so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.
But literally, we are all made of stardust.
our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale,
So, that's what we call our first five employees
fun things we are doing on Mars.
which was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe
Some of the most brilliant engineers I know
Video: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror.
and you can learn the history of what happened in the past
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
And I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said
so we can actually measure the material that it is made of.
So, we used to have a celebration every year and select --
If you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes,
By the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,
BC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour
You can skip the dust part.
a little bit of what's going to happen.
for a signal from Mars to get to Earth.
and expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada.
we couldn't use airbags.
through the plume of that geyser
to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.
But there was something bizarre about it.
As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.
so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,
So let me go on the next short video.
The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering,"
But more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:
and you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.
hey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.
But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination --
of what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe,
in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,
Hopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way.
So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure
If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.
we'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour
but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.
so to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.
from behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun.
and I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.
So, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror
Erik Bailey: The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling
so we don't break that lander.
Naturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then,
are lasting even a hundred days.
I landed probably the best gig of all.
BC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes
which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface.
of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea
This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.
To give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute
and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere
but as I walked out, then it was too cold,
and that's literally why they have lasted so long.
because it's so cold, it could not be water, you know,
I told you I was surprised that those Rovers
to actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails,
a million years ago, 10 million years ago,
But I said I'm going to show you a short clip
is the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole,
and it will be launched June a year from now.
So that's what we call the misguided missile.
So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.
to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests.
about how these Rovers are being viewed by people
and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent,
is being formed in that location.
and then the particles in those rings accumulated together,
So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except
Somehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard
I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing --
The music's half of me, but the other half --
you know, and the serious things that we try to do.
And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.
somehow it ended going sideways.
relative to Mount Everest.
And just to kind of put us in perspective,
a lot of the dust around it created rings
Well, the way I think about it is fairly simple.
so you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover
mixing electronics and acoustics.
it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.
which is about a few football fields in size.
but these are pictures taken from Mars.
EB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide
which are being, you know, emitted from it.
Well, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting.
Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,
So that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know,
Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.
and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.
where life could have existed on the planet in the past.
And also to help you, to help the community
for more abstract sounds and things to play live,
on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.
So, this is called Victoria Crater,
an idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.
because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds.
what these things look like, or why they formed that way.
go do something completely different.
know about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes,
This one I thought I'd show you.
What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know,
that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun,
they were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous,
and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.
These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.
and you can see what's below the surface.
look what everybody is doing, what they are doing;
which are the particles.
We try to avoid blowing ourselves up.
there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,
In general we don't try to please the customer here.
so it looks very much like Earth.
When they were a bunch of kids,
before we got them down -- or that Rover --
And the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,
So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here
without really working at it,
So, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves,
and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you
And that's my recommendation to all of you:
Six to nine months at the right time of the year.
Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,
Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?
Lynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth,
the shape that we want to do.
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed,
Charles Elachi: Now, moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff,
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers
It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem.
As I told you, geologists love craters.
so you can adjust your watch.
EB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself,
because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground
within which we can deploy the parachute.
You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day,
scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this,

You know, it'll take us only six months to get there.

Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors,

We're using cognition to control our behavior.
But in one study, we found that mindfulness training
about what was happening in our momentary experience?
oh, there's tightness, there's tension,
in the contexts that matter most.
And it tries it's hardest to help us change our behavior,
We call this cognitive control.
which isn't that helpful.
and it takes us for a ride.
that goes offline when we get stressed out,
or restrain ourselves from behavior.
or you're trying to distract yourself from work,
Actually, it was exhausting.
So why is it so hard to pay attention?
And each time we do this,
or to eat something sweet.
We become this inner scientist
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,
we were a nerd at school,
"Hey, I want to be cool."

Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior.
But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly

Well, after a while, our creative brains say,

And especially with sugar,

this is also the first part of our brain
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,
why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?"
When I was first learning to meditate,
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking.
We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations --
Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory?
our bodies send a signal to our brain that says,
that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad,
are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing
So if you don't smoke or stress eat,
and basically goes like this.
Well here's an example from one of our smokers.
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs

We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips
to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ...
that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something --
learning processes currently known in science,

that target these core mechanisms
to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns
of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.
which is naturally rewarding.
we've gone from learning to survive
and the spell of smoking was broken.
So what's going on here?
we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns,
In contrast, when we let go --
we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.
This willingness to turn toward our experience
We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids

Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience.
step out of the process
It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved
or trying to force ourselves to pay attention,
we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ...
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.
we learn to repeat the process
And the majority of them had tried this before and failed --

We lay down this context-dependent memory
So we start smoking.
Now, with these same brain processes,

And what happens when we get curious?
"Remember what you're eating and where you found it."
we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious.

actually help other proteins to function well --
by preventing death,
And they can be completely fertile --
And each one of these stars represents a population
doubled the lifespan of the little worm.
And they all come and they fortify the house.
if you could change one of the genes in an experiment,
a signal that things are not okay
whose protein products
Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.
This is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,
as you can see from these stars.
which is a negligible senescence.
then you can imagine that,
So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,
is registered by the animal as a danger signal,
genes I call carrot-giver genes,
it will live longer.
How could that work?
And that's the case all over the world,
like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.
that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2
So if there are genes like that,
Well when the daf-2 receptor is active,
if you give the mouse rapamycin,
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?
in people who live to be 90 or 100.
And we were very lucky to find
And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.
There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,
genes that allow them to have different lifespans.
You could change the genes in principle.
So what about the normal worm?
that old for a mouse --
It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;
in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don't know.
that have found to be more frequently present
looking for long-lived animals.
are genes for aging,
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor
even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,
One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.
of combating lots of different age-related diseases
And maybe they're even set really differently
And next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.
and they also have more progeny every year.
So we started to change genes at random,
that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients
the animal lives longer.
maybe we would have a way
But what we think is that, under conditions of stress,
Now you've all heard of at least insulin.
that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;
to replicate some of these effects in humans,
but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.
because they have different genes.
they would just bind to the protein itself
So there's something about aging that's kind of universal.
have a different normal set point
when it's about college student age -- a young adult.
Just like we all have eyes,
And we were really optimistic that we could find something
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us.
And then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.
Now these animals are different from one another,
would not change the genes,
the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.
And these changes made the gene not act as well
But it's deteriorating.
can have really different lifespans.
These animals have within them
And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?"
So the first thing you're going to see
that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.
you can't tell the difference, just by looking,
but he's there, he's taking care of the building.
And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO
you see that different kinds of animals
So it's really interesting.
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue
that is, changes in the gene
We all have FOXO genes,
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,
Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,
So maybe he's a little bit lazy,
that kind of control would be much better as a drug.
But if you look in nature,
when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.
with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?
The receptor isn't working as well.
extend lifespan in worms
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.
is that there are different forms of it.
And I think that's much better,
kind of like an old shoe.
under favorable conditions -- in the good times --
you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.
just like the daf-2 mutations --
And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.
And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,
And our long-lived mutants are too.
Now the really cool thing about FOXO
the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,
are hormones that are particularly active
And many of these different genes, we've shown,
let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s --
So in a daf-2 mutant --
And mutations that damage the TOR gene --
The animal's clearly in the nursing home.
the lifespan of people.
or hydrogen peroxide, things like that.
was that people who lived to 90 or 100
So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.
And the immune system is more active.
But still, here in the year 2011,
But it's really more like this:
like the insulin pathway.
But everything else is just lying there.
that FOXO genes can impact
like high temperature
for how we think this life extension ability exists.
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully
what you could do now pretty well in the lab,
are more active in these animals.
for staying young longer.
who looks really good for being 90 or 80.
There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,
to a lot of different environmental stresses
but some live to be 90 or 100.
So that's the concept here
and specifically by hormones.
And the way that they're switched on
We don't know the details of how this works,
in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.
even if there isn't a hurricane.
CK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,
This is a dream of the ages.
and recycle them if they're damaged.
they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person
for studies of aging --
And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.
And it's looking like that's the case.
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.
And when I tell people about this,
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.
If you look at birds, which live a long time,
they're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them
maybe they also affect aging.
So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,
like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,
So this is altogether really, really interesting.
to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.
So you can see in black, after a month --
in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.
that don't really do aging.
that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about --
from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.
It takes this worm two days
a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA
or what keeps them from aging.
So for example, there was one study that was done
There are some creatures on this planet already
but our studies suggested
So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,
Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.
they're instructions to make a protein that does something.
that will delay aging and age-related diseases.
Is there any effect on age-related disease?
And nobody knows if they really can live forever,
And there are hints of this.
But I don't think that's a good idea.
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.
then it triggers a series of events
Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,
is not extending human lifespan
It's active. You can't tell the difference really.
So the next question, of course, is:
So maybe it's working in people the same way.

There isn't the technology to do that.
That's what that arrow means.

such that it still works in all these animals.
the levels of these hormones drop --
So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.
which we think makes them live longer.
And it's just sitting on one of them.
So we've been trying in our lab now
It damaged the gene.
And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene
because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution
He gets on the telephone --
and change its activity.
to protect themselves from many kinds of damage,
You would never know, until she told you.
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse --
in something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.
and here it affects lifespan in people.
It's quite a cute little fellow.
as the normal gene would have acted.
actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,
because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.
So it's an ancient pathway,
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.
MR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...
They have the ability
before this age-old dream begins to come true.
That's what it's like. And you would never know.
and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.
and inhibits its activity.
And the 70 year-old ones,
that might even be safer.
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,
and I think it won't be too long, I hope,
that little compartment there in the middle of the cell --
that binds to the TOR protein
that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take

So this is really exciting to me.
but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.
which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.
If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.

Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.
CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about
Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor

which probably most of you haven't seen one --
And that is the case in flies.

where it sends signals into the cell.
which comes out of this science
And you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.
MR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon.
You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans --
so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?
we can increase the health and longevity of people.
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.
will they live longer?
These hormones are similar
And the other part is on the inside

But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human.
So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,
And it isn't until twice as long
And they grow to be about this size.
So you can think of FOXO
to get the benefits without getting any problems.
They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it --

And so it's a matter for you to weigh this, these moral issues.

The yellowfin was also heavily fished.
In order to increase our rate of return, we have to become more involved.
The tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market,
but their accent, they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.
As you look forward,
because we are in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Southern Hemisphere,
AT: This is our wish.
AT: Well, I've been telling this story every year.
And it doesn't feel good at all.
But, as a country, we have made a commitment
and so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands.
They have no concept of what it is that's involved.
and I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish
and yet despite that, a few years ago you took a very radical step.
I've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand.
I met also a family who have married the local people here,
but I remain radically rational, whatever that is.
I think each one is about the size of California.
There's scenarios where it's higher than that, for sure,
What's the problem?"
OK? We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time.
those who choose and want to do that, to migrate.
They started experimenting if they could, per se.
And so we've started doing that,
It's a new experience.
it would be something that they're unable to do
that in order to deal with climate change, in order to fight climate change,
what are your options as a country, as a nation?
CA: You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry,
So this is what's happening,
that you charge for the remaining areas?
the Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu,
it's going to be something quite significant,
And forgoing commercial fishing
it's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones.
Climate change is a global phenomenon, and as I've often argued,
they've been totally destroyed.
It's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people.
I think this made you angry.
CA: Now, a core part of your nation's identity is fishing.
which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops,
I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands.
CA: Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations?
to get the kind of resourcing that we would need.
because much of the land is low.
but what is business like for them?
because then there was still this controversy among the scientists
the Gilbert Group on the west,
These islands are entirely made up of coral atolls,
But we decided to close this, and it was a very difficult decision.
I was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries
It's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge.
I spoke in our language, and of course they spoke back, they replied,
and so it's been a very difficult decision for me.
and the Line Islands in the east.
"You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?"
living in that part of the Solomon Islands,
in governments, hospitals, schools and what have you.
that there might be impending peril for your country?
that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level.
but these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,
and once we migrate into a different environment,
And it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end
The Japanese are interested in building floating islands.
because it would affect the industries.
And so we made the sacrifice.
because what we are getting from license fees
It's already with us.
I had a very good reason, because we have a community of Kiribati people
So in asking the international community to make a sacrifice,
we had waves come over half the island,
which made a categorical statement that it is real, it's human-induced,
So it's not about getting two feet.
and on average about two meters above sea level.
because of these questions about identity,
But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands:

is perhaps the highest in the world.
Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am
and I said, "We are looking at floating islands,"
to stay and continue to exist as a nation.
In the Pacific, I think we own something like 60 percent
to see what we can do about the freshwater lens
and so I've been asked on a number of occasions,
there has got to be sacrifice, there has got to be commitment.
I think what many people do not understand
How do you hold the line?
I saw them, there was this lady with red teeth.
AT: Well, I think we focus too often on licensing
I was very angry, very frustrated and then depressed.
We don't have a lot of livestock,
and I know that on occasions, I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem
AT: The negotiations have been very difficult,
I think I visit a number of --
something like 80 to 90 percent of our revenue
And quite frankly, Kiribati is perhaps the only country
without having been prepared to do so.
but what would you say to a skeptic who said,
What that will take,
a different culture,
Is it getting harder? Are the waters depleted?
It comes with the winds, it comes with the swells,
in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable.
Tell us about Kiribati.
Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country.
We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world.
Usually not more than two kilometers in width.
and there was a gentleman who was interviewing me
What we have been trying to do over the years
And when I came into office in 2003,
In the past, I talked about it.
We want to be able to give the people the choice today,
But at the same time, what's important to note is,
If we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK?
Now we want to produce the fish ourselves.
CA: Well, there's forced migration in your country's past,
I had to change my approach.
CA: So there's so many things playing into this.
and you said, "I don't get angry." But then you paused.
But for our two southernmost islands,
CA: So the country is already seeing effects now.
but try also to understand what I'm saying
on something like this,
you visited these people.
"So how do you feel?"
but I was convinced that we had to do this
And we only get about 10 percent.
They don't understand.
and he thought it was funny, but somebody said,
AT: Well, we are also looking at that
and for the revenues that the country receives
Can you tell us about that?
and so in my trips to the different islands,
And so I have been looking at floating islands.
Some of them later recognized me,
I had to become more reasonable
we don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe.
Of course, our culture is very different, our society is very different,
about how to get the most for your country,
and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades,
We have a plan, we think we have a plan.
that no matter what happens, we will try as much as possible
for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care.
For any vessel to come in to fish for a day,
What happened here? What's the story here?
Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally.
But I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007
Or is that being run on a sustainable basis?
with the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC,
because I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational,
On the one hand, it may prompt healthier fisheries.
I think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much.
But these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand.
And so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that.
"No, this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions."
because in the event that nothing comes forward
and so we will see by the end of this year
except only to supply the domestic market.
because if you do not cut your emissions,
we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,
for countries like mine.
so it's fish that we depend on.
in the Phoenix Islands protected area
CA: And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration.
She was chewing betel nuts,
because it's being destroyed,
where Australia and New Zealand are also members,
now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.
What advice would you give?
in the harvesting, in the processing,
AT: Yes, and I'm sorry, I think somebody was asking
if and when we do migrate.
It's an emotional thing, and I've tried to live with it,
And at the moment, we have been getting
CA: And meanwhile, for your local fishermen,
but we are working towards that,
get the most for the fish?
is about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch
I understand what you're saying,
but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day.
and it's predicting some very serious scenarios
our two southernmost islands,
There had been some indications that some of the species,
And so this is what I tell them.
And so we've got to respond likewise.
AT: Well, we're on the equator,
as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe.
they are still able to fish,
whereas in the past these fishing boats
mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan.
the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost.
and we have to restructure the industry.
and it's not something we do in Kiribati.
and it remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all.
and also in the east and the west of the International Date Line.
I'm getting complaints from different communities
There was a bit of a story in the news
But now they've got ways of doing it, and they've become so efficient.
for quite a number of decades.
and I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate,
or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water
But I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting
Skipjack remains healthy.
Nobody wants ever to leave their home,
is actually to increase our participation in the industry,
And so this is what we have.
As a leader, you don't make plans to leave your island, your home,
AT: Well, we eat fish every day, every day,
what it means in terms of the lost revenue.
So I am a fisherman, very much,
sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet.
There is bound to be a certain loss of identity,
CA: It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day
And on one occasion, I think I spoke in Geneva
now they're catching maybe 100 tons because they've become so efficient.
And so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people.
I began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly,
of the remaining tuna fisheries,
I can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy,
They have had to move, and every parliament session,
and yes, the answer would be to enhance.
that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning.
It's something that's got to be done collectively.
We've got to tell these people that the world has changed.
And so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people,
And Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners,
We are still trying to assess what that loss would be
but I think they were very happy.
And quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment.
tuna resource owners.
There was a sense of futility
because I can't solve the problem.
We don't chew betel nuts.
why we were sneaking off to visit that place.
might be fishing in a day and maybe catch 10 tons,
We've got to be very, very careful because the technology has so improved.
from access fees, license fees.
AT: Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us.
They're not easy to penetrate,
from the global fishing business for tuna,
and all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck.
it became a real issue for us.
And so here I was saying,
was because I had been asking the international community
we have raised the fee from -- it was $6,000 and $8,000,
And so that's when I got very serious.
Either we live on floating islands,
very, very substantial.
and we had an argument.
within five to 10 years.
which drives everything that we do
but not with so much passion,
I'm seeing evidence of communities
is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future.
asking for assistance to build seawalls,
And so there's been that significant increase.
There was serious drought, and the people could not continue to live on the island,
There was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern,
just yesterday or the day before yesterday,
then our survival is on the line.
would mean a loss of revenue.
I thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice.
Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum.
we think it's something that happens gradually.
AT: Well, I think it's got to be understood
We have communities who already have been dislocated.
which is perhaps the more urgent challenge
With the rising sea, they say, "Well, you can move back."
and eventually, hopefully, the marketing.
that a marginal rise in sea level
to try to preserve the nation in a location.
But for the first time, at the beginning of this year,
and so they can be magnified,
CA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there.
And I've just come back from my own constituency,
We don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate
that is actually in the four corners of the world,
Another reason why I did that
would mean a loss of a lot of land,
We create them, and then we send them either north or south.
and so this has never happened before.
and this is what we will be looking for in the future
and this is connected, yes? What happened here?
on the side of the wharf, not in the retail shops.
AT: National revenue,
CA: So you're dependent on fish, both at the local level
the contamination of the water lenses,
and in the process, the very edges of it actually touched
and so this is what is happening.
whether it was human-induced, whether it was real or it wasn't.
AT: I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations.
we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity
As you go into another community, there are bound to be changes.
I mean, how much are you able to move the price up
When was it that you yourself realized
CA: Now, those predictions are, I think, that by 2100,
but when we talk about the rising sea level,
But they aren't supposed to come back.
But even that, it's going to be very, very difficult
But when the scenarios, the predictions came in 2007,
CA: And then, I think the country suffered its first cyclone,
and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator,
unfortunately, the countries, when we come to the United Nations --
from the international community,
there's a whole lot of adjustments that are required.
I think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way.
Is there any advice you can give
because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year,
AT: Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on
in particular the bigeye, was under serious threat.

Now, I want to get back to that compiler.
to reduce the size of the genome that you're building.
So, I'm going to start asking those questions
So, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required
Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist.
You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop,
the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.
you can see that what it really is,
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place,
that's 10 trillion trillion bases long.
They ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.
And what's really neat about it --
One of them is Craig Venter's question.
to have a molecular program know when to stop going.
is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.
some switches that turn your genes on and off,
When you look at DNA origami,
So now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology,
the problem is, you need a long strand
Experimentally, this is what we've done in the last year.
using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together.
of those in a normal computer.
is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.
There are other questions like this, too.
weak jaws that flip over their heads
by combining DNA origami with tiles.
hopefully from some of those big questions,
is that tiles are a kind of molecular program
and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.
This is part of that genome.
And so computation is some very powerful way
by this kind of developmental process
When you zoom in, they've got, you know,
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately,
So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.
And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there.
And the point of this, if you didn't catch that,
we'll make the kind of squares that I described
in development is underlying these amplified, large changes.
Craig Venter, as are all of us.
and you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK?
and build these kinds of things
So, what we've done is we've succeeded
You know, so this is all very cool,
and start to form structure.
And I think in the next five or 10 years,
that -- they indicate to us that a complicated computation
The fact is that it does not scale.
It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer.
So, this works really well
Or how does a computer program know when to stop running?
There's the atomic-force microscope working
to fill in a square in the middle of this thing.
they will start to count -- they will read that 32
the short strands bind the long strands
We've got ideas about how to fix these errors.
that has a nice, long, single-stranded genome
You have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want.
using a little bit of computation.
It feels the DNA origami.
back down and end in a little loop like this.
and when you add those tiles that count,
potentially having nothing to do with biology.
you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern.
to do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.
Double strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus
why isn't DNA origami the end of the story?
You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.
And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use,
that's going to take that description
And if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits,
They're no good either.
and they're floppy when they're single-stranded.
and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?
Then you're going to have a compiler
You can encode the number 32
using DNA in ways that nature never intended,
and building new languages for building things from the bottom up,
visual, computer-aided design way.
and make an orange strand in the other tube,
and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
You can use DNA origami for that.
rebuild everything from the bottom up,
And we like to draw these tiles as little squares.
So, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago,
is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.
then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits,
tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.
where small changes -- single, tiny, little mutations --
You're going to design something like a cell phone,
that we wanted, I tried to make this shape.
you need some kind of input, a kind of seed.
that can bind to other tiles, if they match.
Now, a hallmark of computer programs
or with a larger change, this dog,
made a little switch, you see here, wired it up,
then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.
You're going to sit in front of your computer.
And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing,
and they have little single-stranded bits on them
it could create a six-fingered man.
or another small change, this person;
When we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded,
he's writing genomes that will work,
and you think life is about computation, as I do,
is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami,
If we succeed, what will molecular programming look like?
we need to build something to understand it.
Or if you're familiar with "The Princess Bride,"
and it actually works.
So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles --
So, this sort of recapitulates
So you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.
as Feynman said, you know,
And just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller,
which will build new electronic computers, and so forth.
than DNA origami could otherwise.
rather than a checkerboard.
and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it,
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.
But to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA,
the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need
and it could result in this person;
And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over.
will build new molecular computers,
So, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them,
So there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds --
a lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter.
and design the stuff on a laptop.
and some counters growing off it,
we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square
what's the smallest program I can write
Anyone know what this is? What is it?
which together with electrochemical computers
So now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things
easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this.
and then jump to another one.
And the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations,
It was started by Erik Winfree,
that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen
You get a high-level description of the computer program,
has the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together.
if we used DNA origami alone,
This is exactly analogous to the question,
And if you do that, the origami's the same size,
building electronic computers,
one-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?
We're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest,
by places where short strands go along one helix
So, you can come up with a set of tiles
life uses computation to do that.
called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.
that can make large changes in biological development -- the output.
So, you start with something in the computer.
It's double-stranded, it's a double helix,
How few genes can I use?
And so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.
building electrochemical computers,
And each one of these is just
and looking at big questions in a new light,
and they're held together
and brings the long strand together like this.
We're going to turn to another technology,
So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago
I will say that life involves computation.
that will give me a functioning microorganism?
I think that life has been about molecular computers
floating around in a single drop of water.
So, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about.
What it's really about is taking computer science
are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA.
to create life's very diverse and complex forms,
so we're not going to do this.
The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works.
And I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.
It knows how big it is.
it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.
My little group of molecular programmers
even though you think it's complicated,
I want you to remember that
That's three light years' worth of DNA,
for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next.
well, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork,
and I got 50 billion little smiley faces
It knows when to stop growing because it can count.
Here is a DNA origami rectangle,
and computer programs that could help to convince you.
But a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.
And the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable.
a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.
I mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down,
and they can output patterns.
So now, what do I want you to take away from this talk?
there are lots of similarities between genetic programs
So it's very promising for making small computers.
to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something,
But for some tasks, we can start to answer them.
and some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good.
is it will do a developmental computation,
I ordered them; they came by FedEx.
There's the solar panels of the cell,
We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.
And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true,
This is a photograph
And the thing is, is that this isn't Google.
all for a communications framework
But if you zoom out,
it doesn't take away
So you've effectively negated
and I don't know what,
can even agree on what happened
of what's happening in the stock market right now,
or a 200 million dollar movie.
without any human oversight,
You can find these kinds of things wherever you look,
And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds.
and they ossify and calcify,
and they use math and magic
and nobody to this day
So if you need to have some image
that that's a 30 million dollar movie
because institutional traders have the same problems
algorithms locked in loops with each other,
right through 156 tons of steel in the sky.
because they repeat over and over again,
and you realize that they're not metaphor, they're prophecy.
if you slow it down and attach lights to them,
you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are
and figure out what's actually happening in the market.
and they can tell you, quantifiably,
of algorithms in conflict,
And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.
They acquire the sensibility of truth
and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs,
that's where people are, where the cities are,
and sew them back together
with dynamite and rock saws
which is a very, very difficult problem.
what you see is the evidence
but basically, it's not like

is that the same math
Well, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood,
It's trying to get a grasp on you,
we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals,
Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?
And to understand that,
the world around us and the world inside us.
So none of this mishegas

And they're in your house. They're in your house.
And the magic and the horror of that
Wouldn't that be handy?

So we didn't use a radar;
And the question is:
How does that work?"
And how far can you take that? How far can you take it?
and in a way, they are.
And we've rendered something
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm.
It's what the money motivates,
What would it look like?
It involves light cones and quantum entanglement,

And I said, "What's the black box for Wall Street?"

And he said, "Well we were mostly breaking stealth."

and the fact that we don't really quite have it down,
like the Boston Shuffler could.
because nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it.
And similar topography.
so that an algorithm can close the deal
But the difficulty of the problem
that, of course, these aren't just running through the market.
There's a company in Boston called Nanex,
All of a sudden, nine percent just goes away,
And algorithmic trading evolved in part
we thought, 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.'"
And we're starting to make our way.
and pound for pound and dollar for dollar,
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.
Because the algorithms of Wall Street
that computers use to decide stuff.
I don't know where we are now.
that have very different ideas about what clean means.
is that, if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are,
a company called Epagogix.
And so -- this is an over-simplification --
which are basically the math
of what's actually happening
when we were deep in the valley over there.
nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes,
These are two different cleaning robots

So where do we go from here?

So, this is an emotional topic. Some people stand.
because National Geographic has the theory that

And National Geographic got interested
The extinctions still go on.
So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group
There's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,

and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,
is the first time one of our patients, Bruno, actually walked.
When John Chapin and I, 15 years ago, proposed in a paper
And the most amazing thing is,
And that kick crowned, basically, 30 years of basic research

Flight control is Brazilian. (Laughter)
but it is he who is walking again.
the other monkey to control y and z,

all over the five continents of this beautiful Earth,
when our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking,
some of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon
and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd,
and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that.
We had 18 months to do everything from zero, from scratch.
Paraplegic, quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night.
because that's how we were raised in our respective countries,
representing the mental commands that were taken by the exo
that that voluntary motor will was being enacted, no matter where --
Of course, he will have it whenever he wants.
Because a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup,
Well, we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed,
that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements
without ever experiencing the light in the retina.
and we basically put this exoskeleton together,
to allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground
well, let's have the kickoff of the 2014 World Cup
Juliano rose to the occasion, and on this day did something
learned to control the movements of an avatar arm,
invented by Gordon Cheng, one of my greatest friends, in Munich,
What you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey
a virtual arm that doesn't exist.
Well, we took this to a little higher limit
by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him,
our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help,
the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident.
and the third one to control x and z,
an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal
So what I need to say is that no Turing machine,
was transmitted to a second object, all non-invasive technology.
that allows two animals to exchange mental messages
but he should be controlling now y and z,
because there are a couple of points we want to develop, and, of course,
by getting monkeys to collaborate mentally in a brain net,
because he was wearing the first brain-controlled robotic vest
and the second rat, in 70 percent of the times
the motor planning that the brain is generating
One monkey is controlling the x dimension,
So we went together with these guys
And as this message gave feedback back to the brain,
we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm
dropped their dogs, wives, kids, school, jobs,
What I'm going to show you is how 156 people from 25 countries
and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions.
can send a mental SMS, a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,
We had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,
Basically, the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go.
and congregated to come to Brazil for 18 months to actually get this done.
so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment
In one pulse, the subject saw something.
and the other monkey is reacting to that signal
and send his commands to the controls, the motors,
They looked at us, thought that we were completely nuts,
And dream he did that afternoon, for a stadium of about 75,000 people
he says, "You know, guys,
to the second rat that didn't see any light,
But it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there
it's just brain research.
After nine years without being able to move,

But that's a different talk,
He gets ready, the ball is set, and he kicks.
They have to move an arm in three dimensions.
this kid, this young man that you see celebrating here
or a different pulse, two different pulses.
more than just walking,
was his ability to dream.
he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos,
I wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times.
in a balmy winter afternoon in São Paulo, Brazil,
So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down,
basically to donate their brain activity
and produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair,
Miguel Nicolelis: No, it's a little different.
not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice.
But each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen
a few minutes before we went to the pitch
But what the spinal cord lesion did not rob from Juliano
you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains,
If you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord,
that can be commanded by brain signals
and in 18 months, we got eight patients in a routine of training
the first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see.
a typical South American winter afternoon,
The first brain-controlled exoskeleton to be built
what Juliano accomplished took 30 years to imagine in laboratories
where a monkey, without moving its body,
the brain realized its goal: to make us move.
And that's priceless.
Brain-actuating technology is here.
so that the subject can imagine what he, she or it wants to make move,
no computer can predict what a brain net will do.
We are paid to be children,
we heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful
The perfect Brazilian lunch:
MN: Oh, tens of times.
I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married,
because for some mysterious reason, FIFA cut its broadcast in half.
They have that inside their head.
And by doing that, we converted these signals into digital commands
Sorry, my American friends,
that we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface,
And this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup, and couldn't,
and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation.
And how many times have you succeeded versus failed?
and see my bride and actually be there by myself.
and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed
One day, in a few decades,
The second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex,
the other monkey is controlling the y dimension.
BG: How many times have you tested this?
just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse.
you are going to see two streams of green and yellow light
that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient's brain
And in basically 13 seconds,
So as we saw this happening,
On June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33
And he was able to verbally indicate
The idea was that if you suffered --
15 degrees of freedom, hydraulic machine
And that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking,
but basically the brain activity of one subject
as you are going to see in a moment,
And the same time, he is sending a mental message
because I wanted to walk to the priest
and about 15 years to plan.
and for 12, 15 years,
MN: There was one bit of information -- big ideas start in a humble way --
Where is this going?
So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago,
and when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball,
and basically built from nothing this guy,
without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message,
We got it out of the drawers,

This is the latest: We just published this a year ago,
