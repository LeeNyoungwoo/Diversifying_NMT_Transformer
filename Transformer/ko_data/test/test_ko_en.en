You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.
But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free, as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?

Just existing.
And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.
So, from the perspective of engineering, we can ask: Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system, can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine-based vision systems that can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed by a human programmer?
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.
In 2008, it flew for a whopping 20 seconds, a year later, two minutes, then six, eventually 11.
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired.

These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest trucks in the world are working here, and then you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is basically oil that doesn't flow.
